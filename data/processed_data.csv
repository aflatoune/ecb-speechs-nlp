en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201210~9b8e5f3cdd.en.html,10 December 2020,"while the rebound of economic activity in the third quarter was stronger than expected and the prospects for the roll-out of vaccines are encouraging, the pandemic continues to pose serious risks to public health and to the euro area and global economies. the resurgence in covid-19 cases and the associated containment measures are significantly restricting euro area economic activity, which is expected to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020. while activity in the manufacturing sector continues to hold up well, services activity is being severely curbed by the increase in infection rates and the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility. inflation remains very low in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. overall, the incoming data and our staff projections suggest a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged.  in view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, today the governing council recalibrated its monetary policy instruments as follows:  first, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. second, we decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) by €500 billion to a total of €1,850 billion. we also extended the horizon for net purchases under the pepp to at least the end of march 2022. in any case, we will conduct net purchases until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.  we will conduct our purchases under the pepp to preserve favourable financing conditions over this extended period. we will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. in addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. if favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the pepp, the envelope need not be used in full. equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. the extension of our pepp purchases over a longer horizon reflects the prolonged fallout from the pandemic for the economy and inflation. it allows for a continuous market presence and more durable support from our monetary stimulus. preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period will help to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby encouraging consumer spending and business investment, and, ultimately, underpinning the economic recovery and helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.  we also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2023. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. third, the governing council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii). specifically, we decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable terms will apply by twelve months, to june 2022. we will also conduct three additional operations between june and december 2021. moreover, we decided to raise the total amount that counterparties will be entitled to borrow in tltro iii operations from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of their stock of eligible loans. in order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated tltro iii borrowing conditions will be made available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance target. the extension of the pandemic-related low interest rate period under tltro iii, the addition of more operations and the increase in the amount that can potentially be borrowed will preserve the very attractive funding conditions for banks. this will help to ensure that they can continue to offer favourable lending conditions and have ample liquidity to extend loans to households and firms. fourth, we decided to extend to june 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures adopted by the governing council on 7 and 22 april 2020. the extension of these measures will continue to ensure that banks can make full use of the eurosystem’s liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated tltros. the governing council will reassess the collateral easing measures before june 2022, ensuring that eurosystem counterparties’ participation in tltro iii operations is not adversely affected. fifth, the governing council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (peltros) in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop. sixth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (app) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. we continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates.  we also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  seventh, the eurosystem repo facility for central banks (eurep) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central banks will be extended until march 2022.  finally, we decided to continue conducting our regular lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary.  separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the governing council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 cet. the monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. at the same time, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs. we will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. we therefore continue to stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following a sharp contraction in the first half of 2020, euro area real gdp rebounded strongly and rose by 12.5 per cent, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, although remaining well below pre-pandemic levels. the second wave of the pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures observed since mid-october are expected to result in a renewed significant decline in activity in the fourth quarter, although to a much lesser extent than observed in the second quarter of this year.  economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors, with activity in the services sector being more adversely affected by the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility than activity in the industrial sector. although fiscal policy measures are supporting households and firms, consumers remain cautious in the light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings. moreover, weaker balance sheets and uncertainty about the economic outlook are weighing on business investment.  looking ahead, the news of prospective roll-outs of vaccines allows for greater confidence in the assumption of a gradual resolution of the health crisis. however, it will take time until widespread immunity is achieved, while further resurgences in infections, with challenges to public health and economic prospects, cannot be ruled out. over the medium term, the recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures are lifted and uncertainty recedes. this assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the december 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp growth at -7.3 per cent in 2020, 3.9 per cent in 2021, 4.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. compared with the september 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity has been revised down in the short term, but is seen to broadly recover to the level projected in the september baseline scenario over the medium term.  overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but have become less pronounced. while the news about the prospects for vaccine roll-outs in the near future is encouraging, downside risks remain related to the implications of the pandemic for economic and financial conditions.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual inflation remained unchanged at -0.3 per cent in november. on the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in the german vat rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative until early 2021. thereafter, it is expected to increase owing to the end of the temporary vat reduction in germany and upward base effects in energy price inflation. at the same time, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. once the impact of the pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term. market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at low levels. this assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the december 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 0.2 per cent in 2020, 1.0 per cent in 2021, 1.1 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. compared with the september 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised down for 2020 and 2022.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth of broad money (m3) remained broadly unchanged at 10.5 per cent in october 2020. strong money growth has been supported by the ongoing asset purchases by the eurosystem, which have become the largest source of money creation. in the context of a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money, the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. the growth of lending to the private sector has plateaued, while still recording higher growth rates than prior to the covid-19 pandemic. following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations fell to 6.8 per cent in october, after 7.1 per cent in september. this deceleration has occurred in the context of abating emergency liquidity needs, weak investment and tighter credit conditions on loans to firms, as signalled by our bank lending survey for the euro area for the third quarter of 2020. the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.1 per cent in october, unchanged from september.  overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and european institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in particular for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature. at the same time, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery in the light of the new lockdowns owing to the second wave of the pandemic warrant continued support from national fiscal policies. the three safety nets endorsed by the european council for workers, businesses and sovereigns provide important funding support in this context. the governing council recognises the key role of the next generation eu package and stresses the importance of it becoming operational without delay. it calls on member states to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. this would allow the next generation eu programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of member states’ economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. such structural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions",rebound

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201029~80b00b5789.en.html,29 October 2020,"the resurgence in coronavirus (covid-19) infections presents renewed challenges to public health and the growth prospects of the euro area and global economies. incoming information signals that the euro area economic recovery is losing momentum more rapidly than expected, after a strong, yet partial and uneven, rebound in economic activity over the summer months. the rise in covid-19 cases and the associated intensification of containment measures is weighing on activity, constituting a clear deterioration in the near-term outlook. in fact, while activity in the manufacturing sector has continued to recover, activity in the services sector has been slowing visibly. although fiscal policy measures are supporting households and firms, consumers are cautious in the light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings. moreover, weaker balance sheets and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook are weighing on business investment. headline inflation is being dampened by low energy prices and muted underlying price pressures in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets.  the monetary policy measures that we have taken since early march are helping to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions across the euro area, thereby providing crucial support to underpin economic activity and to safeguard medium-term price stability. at the same time, in the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the governing council will carefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic, prospects for a rollout of vaccines and developments in the exchange rate. the new round of eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in december will allow a thorough reassessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks. on the basis of this updated assessment, the governing council will recalibrate its instruments, as appropriate, to respond to the unfolding situation and to ensure that financing conditions remain favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path. this will foster the convergence of inflation towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  in the meantime, we decided to reconfirm our accommodative monetary policy stance.  we will keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. we will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion. these purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. the purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. this allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. we will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until at least the end of june 2021 and, in any case, until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. we will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2022. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. net purchases under our asset purchase programme (app) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. we continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates. we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  we will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. in particular, our third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp contracted by 11.8 percent, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020. following the trough in april 2020, the euro area economy rebounded strongly in the third quarter, making up about half of the contraction in the first half of the year. the significant surge in coronavirus infection rates and the associated intensification of containment measures since the summer constitute clear headwinds to the short-term outlook. in fact, recent hard data, survey results and high-frequency indicators point to a significant softening in economic activity in the final quarter of the year. moreover, economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors. in particular, activity in the services sector is slowing again as it is the sector most affected by the new restrictions on social activities and mobility. looking ahead, while the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area economy should continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions and an expansionary fiscal stance. overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are clearly tilted to the downside. this largely reflects the recent resurgence in covid-19 infections, the associated intensification of containment measures and a highly uncertain timeline of the pandemic and its implications for economic and financial conditions.  euro area annual inflation decreased to -0.3 percent in september, from -0.2 percent in august, reflecting developments in the prices of energy, non-energy industrial goods and services. on the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in german vat, headline inflation is likely to remain negative until early 2021. moreover, near-term price pressures will remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. once the impact of the pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term. market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain broadly unchanged at low levels. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth rose to 10.4 percent in september 2020, from 9.5 percent in august, thus remaining well above the levels recorded before the covid-19 pandemic. strong money growth continues to reflect domestic credit expansion and the ongoing asset purchases by the eurosystem, as well as precautionary considerations which foster a heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector. in this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate m1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on economic activity. following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 7.1 percent in september, unchanged from august. this, however, masks a moderation in recent monthly loan flows. the annual growth rate of loans to households edged up to 3.1 percent in september, from 3.0 percent in august. growth in loans to the private sector continues to benefit from historically low bank lending rates.  according to our bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2020, credit conditions on loans to firms tightened. while banks indicated that their funding and balance sheet conditions remain supportive, higher risk perceptions could weigh on their attitude towards loan creation. surveyed banks reported a fall in firms’ loan demand in the third quarter, reflecting a decline in emergency liquidity needs and weakening corporate investment. the survey indicates an increase in households’ net demand for loans in the third quarter, while also suggesting the intention to tighten credit standards for households.   overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and european institutions, remain essential to support access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy and the reduction in private demand. while fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery warrant continued support from national fiscal policies. the three safety nets endorsed by the european council for workers, businesses and sovereigns provide important funding support in this context.  the governing council recognises the key role of the next generation eu package and stresses the importance of it becoming operational without delay. provided the funds are deployed for productive public spending and accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies, next generation eu will contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and will increase economic resilience and the growth potential of member states’ economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. such structural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transition",resurgence coronavirus infection present renew challenge public health growth prospect global economy

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200910~5c43e3a591.en.html,10 September 2020,"the incoming data since our last monetary policy meeting in july suggest a strong rebound in activity broadly in line with previous expectations, although the level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. while activity in the manufacturing sector has continued to improve, momentum in the services sector has slowed somewhat recently. the strength of the recovery remains surrounded by significant uncertainty, as it continues to be highly dependent on the future evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. euro area domestic demand has recorded a significant recovery from low levels, although elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook continues to weigh on consumer spending and business investment. headline inflation is being dampened by low energy prices and weak price pressures in the context of subdued demand and significant labour market slack.  against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability. therefore, we decided to reconfirm our accommodative monetary policy stance.  we will keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels

continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. in particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) has registered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households.  the monetary policy measures that we have taken since early march are providing crucial support to underpin the recovery of the euro area economy and to safeguard medium-term price stability. in particular, they support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions. at the same time, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty, the governing council will carefully assess incoming information, including developments in the exchange rate, with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. it continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp contracted by 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020. incoming data and survey results indicate a continued recovery of the euro area economy and point to a strong rebound in gdp growth in the third quarter. alongside a significant rebound in industrial and services production, there are signs of a notable recovery in consumption. recently, momentum has slowed in the services sector compared with the manufacturing sector, which is also visible in survey results for august. the increases in coronavirus infection rates during the summer months constitute headwinds to the short-term outlook. looking ahead, a further sustained recovery remains highly dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. while the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a strengthening in global activity and demand.  this assessment is broadly reflected in the september 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp growth at ‑8.0% in 2020, 5.0% in 2021 and 3.2% in 2022. compared with the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up for 2020 and is largely unchanged for 2021 and 2022.  given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections include two alternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. overall, the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook is seen to remain on the downside. this assessment largely reflects the still uncertain economic and financial implications of the pandemic. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased to ‑0.2% in august, from 0.4% in july. on the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the german vat rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative over the coming months before turning positive again in early 2021. moreover, in the near term price pressures will remain subdued owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply constraints. over the medium term, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, will put upward pressure on inflation. market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have returned to their pre-pandemic levels, but still remain very subdued, while survey-based measures remain at low levels. this assessment is broadly reflected in the september 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual inflation at 0.3% in 2020, 1.0% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. compared with the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation is unchanged for 2020, has been revised up for 2021, and is unchanged for 2022. the unchanged projection for inflation in 2022 masks an upward revision to inflation excluding energy and food – in part reflecting the positive impact of the monetary and fiscal policy measures – which was largely offset by the revised path of energy prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth continued to rise, reaching 10.2% in july 2020, after 9.2% in june. strong money growth reflects domestic credit creation and the ongoing asset purchases by the eurosystem, as well as precautionary considerations which foster a heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector. in this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate m1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained broadly stable in july, standing at 7.0%, compared with 7.1% in june. high rates of corporate loan growth continue to mirror elevated liquidity needs of firms to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital and to further build liquidity buffers, although the rebound in economic activity has resulted in some recovery in their revenues. the annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable at 3.0% in july – the same rate as observed since april 2020. growth in loans to the private sector continues to benefit from historically low bank lending rates. overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and european institutions, will continue to support access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature. the three safety nets endorsed by the european council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a total of €540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. the governing council also strongly welcomes the next generation eu package of €750 billion, which has the potential to significantly support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, strengthen the single market and build a lasting and prosperous recovery.  in order to fully reach its potential, the package will need to be firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level. well-designed structural policies could contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from the crisis, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. targeted structural policies are particularly important to revitalise our economies, with a focus on boosting investment in priority areas such as the green and digital transitions",incoming datum monetary_policy suggest strong rebound activity broadly line previous

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200716~3865f74bf8.en.html,16 July 2020,"incoming information since our last monetary policy meeting in early june signals a resumption of euro area economic activity, although the level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and the outlook remains highly uncertain. both high-frequency and survey indicators bottomed out in april and showed a significant, though uneven and partial, recovery in may and june, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of the lockdown measures. at the same time, actual and expected job and income losses and the exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic and the economic outlook continue to weigh on consumer spending and business investment. headline inflation is being dampened by lower energy prices and price pressures are expected to remain very subdued on account of the sharp decline in real gdp growth and the associated significant increase in economic slack. against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability. therefore, we decided to reconfirm our very accommodative monetary policy stance.  we will keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. we will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion. these purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation. the purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. this allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. we will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until at least the end of june 2021 and, in any case, until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. we will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2022. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. net purchases under our asset purchase programme (app) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. we continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates. we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  we will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. in particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) has registered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households.  the monetary policy measures that we have taken since early march are providing crucial support to underpin the recovery of the euro area economy and to safeguard medium-term price stability. in particular, they support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions. at the same time, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty and significant economic slack, the governing council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. this applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. the governing council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. incoming data and survey results suggest that economic activity improved significantly in may and june from its trough in april, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of the lockdown measures. at the same time, economic indicators remain well below the levels recorded before the pandemic, and the recovery is in its early stages and remains uneven across sectors and jurisdictions. after decreasing by 3.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020, euro area real gdp is expected to have contracted even further overall in the second quarter, broadly in line with the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. signs of a recovery in consumption have emerged, while there has also been a significant rebound in industrial output. at the same time, subdued labour market conditions and precautionary household saving are weighing on consumer spending. weak business prospects and high uncertainty are dampening investment, while the weakness in the global economy is hampering foreign demand for euro area goods and services.  euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although uncertainty about the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains high. in general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. overall, the governing council assesses the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook to remain on the downside. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 0.3% in june, from 0.1% in may, mainly reflecting less negative energy price inflation. on the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the german vat rate, headline inflation is likely to decline again in the coming months before picking up in early 2021. over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have continued to increase from the historical lows reached in mid-march, but overall remain at subdued levels. while survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined since the start of the pandemic, longer-term expectations have been less affected than short and medium-term expectations. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 8.9% in may 2020, from 8.2% in april. strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which continues to be driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. in this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate m1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 7.3% in may 2020, from 6.6% in april, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the context of still anaemic revenues. at the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.0% in may, after declining for two consecutive months, amid ongoing constraints on consumption.  the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2020 provide further insights into these developments. with regard to firms, they show a continued strong upward impact of the pandemic on demand for loans, largely driven by emergency liquidity needs, while financing needs for fixed investment declined. credit standards on loans to firms remained broadly unchanged. the tightening impact of the deterioration in the economic outlook and the associated decline in the creditworthiness of firms was broadly offset by the easing effects of policy measures, particularly the ecb’s liquidity-support measures and government guarantees on loans. however, looking ahead, banks expect a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, in part related to the expected end of the state guarantee schemes. with regard to loans to households, credit standards tightened, reflecting in particular a deterioration in households’ income and employment prospects in the context of the pandemic.   overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and european institutions, will continue to support access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature. the three safety nets endorsed by the european council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. at the same time, the governing council urges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. we therefore strongly welcome the european commission’s next generation eu proposal, which is dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the single market and to building a lasting and prosperous recovery. it is important for the european leaders to quickly agree on an ambitious package.  in order to reach its full potential, the european union’s recovery and resilience facility will need to be firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level. well-designed structural policies could contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from the crisis, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. targeted structural policies are particularly important to rejuvenate our economies, with a focus on accelerating investment

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200604~b479b8cfff.en.html,4 June 2020,"incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction. there has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment. while survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a bottoming-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures, the improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding two months. the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. nonetheless, the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. while headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures are expected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real gdp and the associated significant increase in economic slack. in line with its mandate, the governing council is determined to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and countries. accordingly, we decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual reopening and to safeguard medium-term price stability.  first, the governing council decided to increase the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion. in response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the pepp expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. the purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. this allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.  second, we decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the pepp to at least the end of june 2021. in any case, we will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. third, the governing council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2022. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. fourth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (app) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. we continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates. fifth, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  sixth, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, today’s decisions will support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, in order to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout. at the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the governing council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. this applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. the governing council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions. the coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. in the first quarter of 2020, when containment measures were only in place from mid-march in most countries, euro area real gdp decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter. information from surveys, high-frequency indicators and incoming hard data all point to a further significant contraction of real gdp in the second quarter. most recent indicators suggest some bottoming-out of the downturn in may as parts of the economy gradually reopen. accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains highly uncertain.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. in the baseline scenario of the projections, annual real gdp is expected to fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 5.2% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022. compared with the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022. given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections also include two alternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. in general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. overall, the governing council sees the balance of risks around the baseline projection to the downside.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased to 0.1% in may, down from 0.3% in april, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation. on the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year. over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. while survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected.  this assessment is also reflected in the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. compared with the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 8.3% in april 2020, from 7.5% in march. strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. in this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate m1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6% in april 2020, up from 5.5% in march, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the context of rapidly declining revenues. at the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households decreased to 3.0% in april, from 3.4% in march, amid consumption constraints due to the containment measures, declining confidence and a deteriorating labour market.  our policy measures, in particular the very favourable terms for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii), should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities. together with the measures adopted by national governments and european institutions, they support ongoing access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. measures taken should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency. the three safety nets endorsed by the european council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. at the same time, the governing council urges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. we therefore strongly welcome the european commission’s proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most severely hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the single market and to building a lasting and

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200430~ab3058e07f.en.html,30 April 2020,"the euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime. measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus (covid-19) have largely halted economic activity in all the countries of the euro area and across the globe. survey indicators for consumer and business sentiment have plunged, suggesting a sharp contraction in economic growth and a profound deterioration in labour market conditions. given the high uncertainty surrounding the ultimate extent of the economic fallout, growth scenarios produced by ecb staff suggest that euro area gdp could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, depending crucially on the duration of the containment measures and the success of policies to mitigate the economic consequences for businesses and workers. as the containment measures are gradually lifted, these scenarios foresee a recovery in economic activity, although its speed and scale remain highly uncertain. inflation has declined as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices and slightly lower hicp inflation excluding energy and food. the decisive and targeted policy measures that we have taken since early march have provided crucial support to the euro area economy and especially to the sectors most exposed to the crisis. in particular, our measures are supporting liquidity conditions and helping to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), and to maintain favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions. we welcome the measures taken by euro area governments and the european institutions to ensure sufficient healthcare resources and to provide support to affected companies, workers and households. at the same time, continued and ambitious efforts are needed, notably through joint and coordinated policy action, to guard against downside risks and to underpin the recovery. in line with our mandate, the governing council is determined to continue to support households and firms in the face of the current economic disruption and heightened uncertainty, in order to safeguard medium-term price stability.  accordingly, the governing council decided today to further ease the conditions on our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii). specifically, we decided to reduce the interest rate on tltro iii operations during the period from june 2020 to june 2021 to 50 basis points below the average interest rate on the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations prevailing over the same period. moreover, for counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the lending performance threshold, the interest rate over the period from june 2020 to june 2021 will now be 50 basis points below the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the same period. we also decided on a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (peltros) to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop. the peltros consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in may 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between july and september 2021 in line with the duration of our collateral easing measures. they will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations prevailing over the life of each peltro.  further details on the amendments made to the terms of tltro iii and on our new peltros will be published in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 cet. since the end of march we have been conducting purchases under our new pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp), which has an overall envelope of €750 billion, to ease the overall monetary policy stance and to counter the severe risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus pandemic. these purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. we will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over, but in any case until the end of this year.  moreover, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (app) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. we continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates. we also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  in addition, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures will support liquidity and funding conditions and help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy. at the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the governing council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. this applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. we are, therefore, fully prepared to increase the size of the pepp and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. in any case, the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the latest economic indicators and survey results covering the period since the coronavirus spread to the euro area have shown an unprecedented decline, pointing to a significant contraction in euro area economic activity and to rapidly deteriorating labour markets. the coronavirus pandemic and the associated containment measures have severely affected the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. in the first quarter of 2020, which was only partially affected by the spread of the coronavirus, euro area real gdp decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, reflecting the impact of the lockdown measures in the final weeks of the quarter. the sharp downturn in economic activity in april suggests that the impact is likely to be even more severe in the second quarter. looking beyond the immediate disruption stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, euro area growth is expected to resume as the containment measures are gradually lifted, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity. given the highly uncertain duration of the pandemic, the likely extent and duration of the imminent recession and the subsequent recovery are difficult to predict. however, without pre-empting the forthcoming eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which will be published in june, growth scenarios produced by ecb staff suggest that euro area gdp could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, followed by a recovery and normalisation of growth in subsequent years. the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the success of the containment measures, how far supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected, and the success of policies in mitigating the adverse impact on incomes and employment.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased from 0.7% in march to 0.4% in april, largely driven by lower energy price inflation, but also slightly lower hicp inflation excluding energy and food. on the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline considerably further over the coming months. the sharp downturn in economic activity is expected to lead to negative effects on underlying inflation over the coming months. however, the medium-term implications of the coronavirus pandemic for inflation are surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand may be partially offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions. market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. even though survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected.   turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 7.5% in march 2020, from 5.5% in february. money growth reflects bank credit creation for the private sector, which is driven to a large extent by drawing on credit lines, and low opportunity costs of holding m3 relative to other financial instruments, while heightened economic uncertainty appears to have triggered a shift towards monetary holdings, likely for precautionary reasons. in this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate m1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. developments in loans to the private sector have also been shaped by the impact of the coronavirus. the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in march 2020, after 3.7% in february, while the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 5.4% in march, after 3.0% in february. these developments are also clearly visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020, which indicate a surge in firms’ demand for loans and for drawing on credit lines to meet liquidity needs for working capital, while financing needs for fixed investment declined. demand for loans to households for house purchase increased less than in the previous quarter. credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly, while credit standards for loans to households tightened more strongly. in both cases, this was related to the deterioration in the economic outlook and a decline in the creditworthiness of firms and households. at the same time, banks expect an easing of credit standards for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2020.  our policy measures, in particular the more favourable terms for tltro iii operations and the collateral easing measures, should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities. together with the credit support measures adopted by national governments and european institutions, they support ongoing access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. measures taken should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency. we welcome the endorsement by the european council of the eurogroup agreement on the three safety nets for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion. at the same time, the governing council urges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. in this regard, we welcome

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200312~f857a21b6c.en.html,12 March 2020,"since our last governing council meeting in late january, the spread of the coronavirus (covid-19) has been a major shock to the growth prospects of the global and euro area economies and has heightened market volatility. even if ultimately temporary in nature, it will have a significant impact on economic activity. in particular, it will slow down production as a result of disrupted supply chains and reduce domestic and foreign demand, especially through the adverse impact of the necessary containment measures. in addition, the heightened uncertainty negatively affects expenditure plans and their financing.   governments and all other policy institutions are called upon to take timely and targeted actions to address the public health challenge of containing the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate its economic impact. in particular, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal policy response is required to support businesses and workers at risk. the governing council strongly supports the commitment of euro area governments and the european institutions to joint and coordinated policy action in response to the repercussions of the spread of the coronavirus. we also welcome the decisions taken by the ecb’s supervisory board, which are detailed in a separate press release published earlier today.  in line with our mandate, the governing council is determined to support households and firms in the face of the current economic disruptions and heightened uncertainty. accordingly, we decided on a comprehensive package of monetary policy measures. together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures will support liquidity and funding conditions for households, businesses and banks and will help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy. first, we decided to conduct, temporarily, additional longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area financial system. although we do not see material signs of strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the banking system, these operations will provide an effective backstop in case of need. they will be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the average rate on the deposit facility. the ltros will provide liquidity at favourable terms to bridge the period until the tltro iii operation in june 2020.  second, the governing council decided to apply considerably more favourable terms during the period from june 2020 to june 2021 to all tltro iii operations outstanding during that same time. these operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. throughout this period, the interest rate on these tltro iii operations will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations. for counterparties that maintain their levels of credit provision, the rate applied in these operations will be lower, and, over the period ending in june 2021, can be as low as 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility. moreover, the maximum total amount that counterparties will henceforth be entitled to borrow in tltro iii operations is raised to 50% of their stock of eligible loans as at 28 february 2019. in this context, the governing council will mandate the eurosystem committees to investigate collateral easing measures to ensure that counterparties continue to be able to make full use of our funding support.  third, we decided to add a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of €120 billion until the end of the year, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes. in combination with the existing asset purchase programme (app), this will support favourable financing conditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty. we continue to expect net asset purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates. in addition, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. we also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. further details on the precise terms of our new operations will be published in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 cet.  in view of current developments, the governing council will continue to monitor closely the implications of the spread of the coronavirus for the economy, for medium-term inflation and for the transmission of its monetary policy. the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the latest indicators suggest a considerable worsening of the near-term growth outlook. the disruption of supply chains is impeding production plans in the manufacturing sector, while necessary containment measures against the further spread of the coronavirus are adversely affecting economic activity. before the coronavirus outbreak, euro area real gdp growth moderated to 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.3% in the third quarter. this mainly reflected the ongoing weakness in the euro area manufacturing sector and slowing investment growth. looking beyond the disruption stemming from the coronavirus, euro area growth is expected to regain traction over the medium term, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and the expected resumption in global activity. this assessment is only partly reflected in the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, as their data cut-off date predates the most recent rapid spread of the coronavirus to the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 0.8% in 2020, 1.3% in 2021 and 1.4% in 2022. in particular, the projections foresee very muted growth in the first half of 2020, followed by an improvement in the second half of the year. compared with the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down notably for 2020 and slightly for 2021, on account of the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are clearly on the downside. in addition to the previously identified risks related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, the spread of the coronavirus adds a new and substantial source of downside risk to the growth outlook.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased to 1.2% in february 2020, from 1.4% in january. on the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline considerably over the coming months. indicators of inflation expectations have fallen and measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted. while labour cost pressures have so far remained resilient amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. over the medium term, the increase in inflation will be supported by our monetary policy measures and the recovery in euro area growth dynamics.  this assessment is only partly reflected in the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. compared with the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation is broadly unrevised over the projection horizon. the implications of the coronavirus for inflation are surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand may be offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions. the recent sharp decline in oil prices poses significant downside risks to the short-term inflation outlook.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 5.2% in january 2020, having moderated somewhat from its recent peak. money growth continues to reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 relative to other financial instruments. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. loans to the private sector continued to expand. the annual growth rate of loans to households picked up somewhat to 3.7% in january 2020, from 3.6% in december 2019. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.2% in january, confirming the moderation seen since autumn 2019 and likely reflecting the typically lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy. overall, our accommodative monetary policy stance, including the measures taken today, will safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, including for those affected most by the ramifications of the coronavirus and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is now needed in view of the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialisation of downside risks. we welcome the measures already taken by several governments to ensure sufficient health sector resources and to provide support to affected companies and employees. in particular, measures such as providing credit guarantees are needed to complement and reinforce the monetary policy measures taken today. we welcome the commitment of the euro area governments and the european institutions to act now, strongly, and together in response to the repercussions of the further spread of the coronavirus",govern late spread coronavirus major shock growth prospect global economy

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200123~0bc778277b.en.html,23 January 2020,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. we will continue to make net purchases under our asset purchase programme (app) at a monthly pace of €20 billion. we expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates.  we also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. today the governing council also decided to launch a review of the ecb’s monetary policy strategy. further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release today at 15:30 cet. the incoming data since our last meeting are in line with our baseline scenario of ongoing, but moderate, growth of the euro area economy. in particular, the weakness in the manufacturing sector remains a drag on euro area growth momentum. however, ongoing, albeit decelerating, employment growth and increasing wages continue to support the resilience of the euro area economy. while inflation developments remain subdued overall, there are some signs of a moderate increase in underlying inflation in line with expectations.  the unfolding monetary policy measures are underpinning favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. in particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are supporting consumer spending and business investment. this will sustain the euro area expansion, the build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim.  at the same time, in the light of the continued subdued inflation outlook, monetary policy has to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. we will, therefore, closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy. our forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. in any case, the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.2% in the second quarter. this pattern of moderate growth reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties, which has particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and has also dampened investment growth. at the same time, the services and construction sectors remain more resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. incoming economic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in euro area growth dynamics, with near-term growth expected to be similar to rates observed in previous quarters. looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding.  euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1.3% in december 2019, from 1.0% in november, reflecting mainly higher energy price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. while indicators of inflation expectations remain at low levels, recently they have either stabilised or ticked up slightly. measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted, although there are further indications of a moderate increase in line with previous expectations. while labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. over the medium term, inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 5.6% in november 2019, broadly unchanged since august. sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 relative to other financial instruments. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. the growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the ongoing support provided by our accommodative monetary policy stance, which is reflected in very low bank lending rates. while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged from october, at 3.5% in november, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations moderated to 3.4% in november, from 3.8% in october, likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy. these developments are also visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2019, which indicate weakening demand for loans to firms, while demand for loans to households for house purchase continued to increase. however, credit standards for both loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged, pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions. overall, our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. the 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to continue to provide some support to economic activity. in view of the weak economic outlook, the governing council welcomes the eurogroup’s call in december for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate. governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. in countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. all countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.  likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the european union’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. improving the functioning of economic and monetary union remains a priority. the governing council welcomes the ongoing

council meeting in late october point to continued muted inflation pressures and weak euro area growth dynamics, although there are some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild increase in underlying inflation in line with previous expectations. ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy.   the

weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and is dampening investment growth. at the same time, incoming economic data and survey information, while remaining weak overall, point to some stabilisation in the slowdown of economic growth in the euro area. the services and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. this assessment is broadly reflected in the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.1% in 2020 and 1.4% in both 2021 and 2022. compared with the september 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down slightly for 2020. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become somewhat less pronounced.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation increased from 0.7% in october 2019 to 1.0% in november, reflecting mainly higher services and food price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to rise somewhat in the coming months. indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted, although there are some indications of a mild increase in line with previous expectations. while

the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised up slightly for 2020 and down slightly for 2021, mainly driven by the expected future path of energy prices. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 5.6% in october 2019, unchanged from the previous month. sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 relative to other financial instruments. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. the growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. the annual growth rate of loans to

in any case, the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  the incoming data since the last governing council meeting in early september confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflation pressures. at the same time, ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. the comprehensive package of policy measures that we decided at our last meeting provides substantial monetary stimulus, which will contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households. this will support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the second half of this year. this slowdown in growth mainly reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties, which continue to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and are dampening investment growth. at the same time, the services and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation. the euro area expansion is supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. in particular, these risks pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. euro area annual hicp inflation decreased from 1.0% in august 2019 to 0.8% in september, reflecting lower food and energy price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline slightly further before rising again at the end of the year. measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. while labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. over the medium term inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 5.7% in august 2019, after 5.1% in july. sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. the growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 4.3% in august, from 4.0% in july 2019, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.4% in august. the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2019 indicates a slight easing of credit standards and increasing demand for loans to households, while demand for loans to firms remained broadly stable. our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. the 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing some support to economic activity. in view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner. in countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. all countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. likewise, the

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190912~658eb51d68.en.html,12 September 2019,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective. first, as regards the key ecb interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.50%. the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.00% and 0.25% respectively. we now expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. second, the governing council decided to restart net purchases under its asset purchase programme (app) at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from 1 november. we expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates.  third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. fourth, we decided to change the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. the interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the average rate applied in the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro. for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in tltro iii operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation. the maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years.  fifth, in order to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy the governing council decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in which part of banks’ holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate.  separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the governing council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 cet. the governing council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time and continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.  today’s decisions were taken in response to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to our aim. in fact, incoming information since the last governing council meeting indicates a more protracted weakness of the euro area economy, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflationary pressures. this is reflected in the new staff projections, which show a further downgrade of the inflation outlook.  at the same time, robust employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. with today’s comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions, we are providing substantial monetary stimulus to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the third quarter of this year. this slowdown in growth mainly reflects the prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector.  at the same time, the services and construction sectors show ongoing resilience and the euro area expansion is also supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. this assessment is broadly reflected in the september 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.1% in 2019, 1.2% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. compared with the june 2019 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down for 2019 and 2020. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. these risks mainly pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.0% in august 2019, unchanged from july. lower energy inflation was offset by higher food inflation, while the rate of hicp inflation excluding food and energy was unchanged. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year. measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. while labour cost pressures strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, their pass-through to inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated. over the medium term underlying inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the september 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.0% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. compared with the june 2019 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised down over the whole projection horizon, reflecting lower energy prices and the weaker growth environment.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 5.2% in july 2019, after 4.5% in june. sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.9% in july 2019. the annual growth rate of overall loans to non-financial corporations continues to be solid, although short-term loans – which are more sensitive to the cycle – show signs of weakness. the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in july, after 3.3% in june, continuing its gradual improvement. overall, loan growth is still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates.  the monetary policy measures we have taken today, including the more accommodative terms of the new series of tltros, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. the 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost.  regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing some support to economic activity. in view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner. in countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies that will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. all countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.  likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the european union’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. improving the functioning of economic and monetary union remains a priority. the governing council

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190725~547f29c369.en.html,25 July 2019,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim over the medium term.  we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. the governing council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its aim. accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of our aim, the governing council is determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. it therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner. in this context, we have tasked the relevant eurosystem committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce our forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases. incoming information since the last governing council meeting in early june indicates that, while further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the economy, softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade are still weighing on the euro area outlook. moreover, the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is dampening economic sentiment, notably in the manufacturing sector. in this environment, inflationary pressures remain muted and indicators of inflation expectations have declined. therefore, a significant degree of monetary stimulus continues to be necessary to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following a rise of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018, euro area real gdp increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019. incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to somewhat slower growth in the second and third quarters of this year. this mainly reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. at the same time, activity levels in the services and construction sectors are resilient and the labour market is still improving. looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, reflecting the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1.3% in june 2019, from 1.2 % in may, as higher hicp inflation excluding food and energy more than offset lower energy price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months, before rising again towards the end of the year. looking through the recent volatility due to temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted. indicators of inflation expectations have declined. while labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, the pass-through of cost pressures to inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated. over the medium term underlying inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 4.5% in june 2019, after 4.8% in may. sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.8% in june 2019. notwithstanding some moderation from the peak recorded in september 2018, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be robust. the annual growth rate of loans to households also remained unchanged at 3.3% in june, continuing its gradual improvement. overall, loan growth is still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates. the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2019 indicates that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories. at the same time, credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in the second quarter amid concerns about the economic outlook, while they remained broadly unchanged for loans for house purchase. our monetary policy measures, including the forthcoming new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii), will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190606~32b6221806.en.html,6 June 2019,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective. first, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  second, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. third, regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii), we decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro. for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in tltro iii will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points.  a press release with further details of the terms of tltro iii will be published at 15:30 cet today.  the governing council also assessed that, at this point in time, the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation is not undermined by possible side effects on bank-based intermediation. however, we will continue to monitor carefully the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures. today’s monetary policy decisions were taken to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. despite the somewhat better than expected data for the first quarter, the most recent information indicates that global headwinds continue to weigh on the euro area outlook. the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is leaving its mark on economic sentiment.  at the same time, further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation. today’s policy measures ensure that financial conditions will remain very favourable, supporting the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term. looking ahead, the governing council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp rose by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, following an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018. however, incoming economic data and survey information point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year. this reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are weighing, in particular, on the euro area manufacturing sector. at the same time, the euro area services and construction sectors are showing resilience and the labour market is continuing to improve. looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. compared with the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points for 2020 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2021.  the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.2% in may 2019, after 1.7% in april, reflecting mainly lower energy and services price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months, before rising again towards the end of year. looking through the recent volatility due to temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures continue to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.3% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. compared with the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2020. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 4.7% in april 2019, after 4.6% in march. sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.9% in april 2019, from 3.6% in march. beyond short-term volatility, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations has moderated somewhat in recent months from its peak in september 2018, reflecting the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth observed over the course of 2018. the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in april, compared with 3.3% in march, continuing its gradual improvement.  the monetary policy measures taken today, including tltro iii, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the

unchanged. we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. details on the precise terms of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltros) will be communicated at one of our forthcoming meetings. in particular, the pricing of the new tltro-iii operations will take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the economic outlook. in the context of our regular assessment, we will also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy requires the mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, on bank intermediation. the information that has become available since the last governing council meeting in early march confirms slower growth momentum extending into the current year. while there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are fading, global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments. the persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is leaving marks on economic sentiment. at the same time, further employment gains and rising wages continue to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. however, an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion, and thus to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. significant monetary policy stimulus is being provided by our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of tltros.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, following an increase of 0.1% in the third quarter. incoming data continue to be weak, especially for the manufacturing sector, mainly on account of the slowdown in external demand, which has been compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. as the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, the slower growth momentum is expected to extend into the current year. looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind. the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in global activity. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.4% in march 2019, after 1.5% in february, reflecting mainly a decline in food, services and non-energy industrial goods price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months. measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 4.3% in february 2019, from 3.8% in january. looking through some volatility in monthly flows, m3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation, notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rebounded to 3.7% in february 2019, from 3.4% in january, reflecting mainly a base effect. looking through short-term volatility, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations has moderated in recent months, reflecting the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth. at the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3% in february. the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2019 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable.  our monetary policy measures, including the new series of tltros that we announced in march, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. at the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. all countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the european union’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. improving the functioning of economic and monetary union remains a priority. the governing council welcomes the ongoing work and urges

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190307~de1fdbd0b0.en.html,7 March 2019,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective. first, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  second, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. third, we decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro-iii), starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021, each with a maturity of two years. these new operations will help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy. under tltro-iii, counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 february 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations over the life of each operation. like the outstanding tltro programme, tltro‑iii will feature built-in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable. further details on the precise terms of tltro-iii will be communicated in due course.  fourth, we will continue conducting our lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021.  today’s monetary policy decisions were taken to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. while there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are starting to fade, the weakening in economic data points to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extend into the current year. the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets appears to be leaving marks on economic sentiment. moreover, underlying inflation continues to be muted. the weaker economic momentum is slowing the adjustment of inflation towards our aim. at the same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. today’s decisions will support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. significant monetary policy stimulus will continue to be provided by our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of tltros. in any event, the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.1% in the third quarter. incoming data have continued to be weak, in particular in the manufacturing sector, reflecting the slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, which suggests that the near-term growth outlook will be weaker than previously anticipated. looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind. the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in global activity. this assessment is broadly reflected in the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.1% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down substantially in 2019 and slightly in 2020. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are still tilted to the downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.5% in february 2019, after 1.4% in january, reflecting somewhat higher energy and food price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain at around current levels before declining towards the end of year. measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised down across the projection horizon, reflecting in particular the more subdued near-term growth outlook. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth decreased to 3.8% in january 2019, from 4.1% in december 2018. m3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation, notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations declined to 3.3% in january 2019, from 3.9% in december 2018, reflecting a base effect but also, in some countries, the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic activity, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained at 3.2%. borrowing conditions for firms and households are still favourable, as the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. the policy measures decided today, and in particular the new series of tltros, will help to ensure that bank lending conditions remain favourable going forward. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. this is particularly important in view of the overall limited implementation of the 2018 country-specific recommendations, as recently communicated by the european commission. regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. at the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. all countries should continue to increase efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the european union’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of

to be weaker than previously anticipated. looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, lower energy prices, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in global activity.  the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.  euro area annual hicp inflation declined to 1.6% in december 2018, from 1.9% in november, reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months. measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. turning to

of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3%. the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable, following an extended period of net easing, and demand for bank credit continued to rise, thereby underpinning loan growth.  the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the

unchanged. we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, our net purchases under the asset purchase programme (app) will end in december 2018. at the same time, we are enhancing our forward guidance on reinvestment. accordingly, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.    while incoming information has been weaker than expected, reflecting softer external demand but also some country and sector-specific factors, the underlying strength of domestic demand continues to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. this supports our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after the end of our net asset purchases. at the same time, uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets, continues to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim. in any event, the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as

economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.4% in the previous two quarters. the latest data and survey results have been weaker than expected, reflecting a diminishing contribution from external demand and some country and sector-specific factors. while some of these factors are likely to unwind, this may suggest some slower growth momentum ahead. at the same time, domestic demand, also backed by our accommodative monetary policy stance, continues to underpin the economic expansion in the euro area. the strength of the labour market, as reflected in ongoing employment gains and rising wages, still supports private consumption. moreover, business investment is benefiting from domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and improving balance sheets. residential investment remains robust. in addition, the expansion in global activity is still expected to continue, supporting euro area exports, although at a slower pace. this assessment is broadly reflected in the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.9% in 2018, 1.7% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. compared with the september 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised slightly down in 2018 and 2019. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. however, the balance of risks is moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation declined to 2.0% in november 2018, from 2.2% in october, reflecting mainly a decline in energy inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decrease over the coming months. measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but domestic cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.8% in 2018, 1.6% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021. compared with the september 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised slightly up for 2018 and down for 2019. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 3.9% in october 2018, after 3.6% in september. apart from some volatility in monthly flows, m3 growth continues to be supported by bank credit creation. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. in line with the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014, the growth of loans to the private sector continues to support the economic expansion. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.9% in october 2018, after 4.3% in september, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.2%. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. regarding fiscal policies, the governing council reiterates the need for rebuilding

positions. likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the eu’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. improving the functioning of economic and monetary union remains a priority. the governing council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to

unchanged. we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (app) at the new monthly pace of €15 billion until the end of december 2018. we anticipate that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. we intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.    incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. the underlying strength of the economy continues to support our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. at the same time, uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. this support will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates. in any event, the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in both the first and the second quarter of 2018. incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with our baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic expansion, supported by domestic demand and continued improvements in the labour market. some recent sector-specific developments are having an impact on the near-term growth profile. our monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. private consumption is fostered by ongoing employment growth and rising wages. at the same time, business investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and corporate profitability. housing investment remains robust. in addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to continue supporting euro area exports, though at a slower pace. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. at the same time, risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 2.1% in september 2018, from 2.0% in august, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level over the coming months. while measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase further over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 3.5% in september 2018, after 3.4% in august. apart from some volatility in monthly flows, m3 growth is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. the growth of loans to the private sector strengthened further, continuing the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose to 4.3% in september 2018, from 4.1% in august, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.1%, unchanged from the previous month. the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and favorable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans for house purchase. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. regarding fiscal policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. this is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the stability and growth pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the eu’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. improving the functioning of economic and monetary union remains a priority. the

performance in 2017, the latest economic indicators and survey results overall confirm ongoing broad-based growth of the euro area economy. our monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by rising wages. business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. housing investment remains robust. in addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to continue, supporting euro area exports. this assessment is broadly reflected in the september 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. compared with the june 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019, mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. at the same time, risks relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have gained more prominence recently.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.0% in august 2018, down from 2.1% in july. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. while measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and rising wage growth. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the september 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which is unchanged from the june 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth declined to 4.0% in july 2018, from 4.5% in june. apart from some volatility in monthly flows, m3 growth is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.1% in july 2018, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.0%, both unchanged from june.  the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and

with the economic analysis. quarterly real gdp growth moderated to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.7% in the previous three quarters. this easing reflects a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017 and is related mainly to weaker impetus from previously very strong external trade, compounded by an increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply-side factors at both the domestic and the global level. the latest economic indicators and survey results have stabilised and continue to point to ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth, in line with the june 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. housing investment remains robust. in addition, the broad-based expansion in global demand is expected to continue, thus providing impetus to euro area exports. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. uncertainties related to global factors, notably the threat of protectionism, remain prominent. moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility continues to warrant monitoring. euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 2.0% in june 2018, from 1.9% in may, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. while measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth increased to 4.4% in june 2018, up from 4.0% in may. m3 growth continues to benefit from the impact of the ecb’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose to 4.1% in june 2018, after 3.7% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 2.9%. the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by easing credit standards and increasing demand across all loan categories. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area.  to sum up, a

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180614.en.html,14 June 2018,"since the start of our asset purchase programme (app) in january 2015, the governing council has made net asset purchases under the app conditional on the extent of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. today, the governing council undertook a careful review of the progress made, also taking into account the latest eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. as a result of this assessment, the governing council concluded that progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation has been substantial so far. with longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, the underlying strength of the euro area economy and the continuing ample degree of monetary accommodation provide grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation towards our aim will continue in the period ahead, and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases.  accordingly, the governing council today made the following decisions:  first, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases under the app at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of september 2018. we anticipate that, after september 2018, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of december 2018 and then end net purchases. second, we intend to maintain our policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.    third, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and we expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. today’s monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that will ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. this support will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates. in any event, the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. quarterly real gdp growth moderated to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.7% in the previous quarters. this moderation reflects a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017, compounded by an increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply-side factors at both the domestic and the global level, as well as weaker impetus from external trade. the latest economic indicators and survey results are weaker, but remain consistent with ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth. our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. housing investment remains robust. in addition, the broad-based expansion in global demand is expected to continue, thus providing impetus to euro area exports. this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. compared with the march 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. nevertheless, uncertainties related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have become more prominent. moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility warrants monitoring.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1.9% in may 2018, from 1.2% in april. this reflected higher contributions from energy, food and services price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. while measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. domestic cost pressures are strengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and rising wages. uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding. looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. compared with the march 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised up notably for 2018 and 2019, mainly reflecting higher oil prices. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth stood at 3.9% in april 2018, after 3.7% in march and 4.3% in february. while the slower momentum in m3 dynamics over recent months mainly reflects the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases since the beginning of the year, m3 growth continues to be supported by the impact of the ecb’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth, although its annual growth rate has receded in recent months from the high rates previously observed. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.3% in april 2018, unchanged from the previous month, and the annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable, at 2.9%.  the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. this is also reflected in the results of the latest survey on the access to finance of enterprises in the euro area, which indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises in particular benefited from improved access to financing. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that today’s monetary policy decisions will ensure the ample degree of monetary accommodation necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. this is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. a full, transparent and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. improving the functioning of economic and monetary union remains

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180426.en.html,26 April 2018,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €30 billion, are intended to run until the end of september 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. the eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. this will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.  following several quarters of higher than expected growth, incoming information since our meeting in early march points towards some moderation, while remaining consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion of the euro area economy. the underlying strength of the euro area economy continues to support our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. in this context, the governing council will continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate and other financial conditions with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook. overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. this continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the ongoing and forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp increased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017, following similar growth in the previous quarter. this resulted in an average annual growth rate of 2.4% in 2017 – the highest since 2007. the latest economic indicators suggest some moderation in the pace of growth since the start of the year. this moderation may in part reflect a pull-back from the high pace of growth observed at the end of last year, while temporary factors may also be at work. overall, however, growth is expected to remain solid and broad-based. our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, should continue to underpin domestic demand. private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. housing investment continues to improve. in addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. however, risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have become more prominent.  euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1.3% in march 2018, from 1.1% in february. this reflected mainly higher food price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. measures of underlying inflation remain subdued overall. looking ahead, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual growth rate of 4.2% in february 2018, slightly below the narrow range observed since mid-2015. m3 growth continues to reflect the impact of the ecb’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth, continuing to expand at a solid annual rate. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.1% in february 2018, after 3.4% in january and 3.1% in december 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 2.9%. the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and a further easing in overall bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans for house purchase.  the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing ‒ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises ‒ and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must

data and survey results indicate continued strong and broad-based growth momentum. our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. private consumption is supported by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. housing investment has improved further over recent quarters. in addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports. this assessment is broadly reflected in the march 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. compared with the december 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly balanced. on the one hand, the prevailing positive cyclical momentum could lead to stronger growth in the near term. on the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors, including rising protectionism and developments in foreign exchange and other financial markets. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased to 1.2% in february 2018, from 1.3% in january. this reflected mainly negative base effects in unprocessed food price inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. measures of underlying inflation remain subdued overall. looking forward, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.4% in 2018, 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. compared with the december 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised down slightly for 2019 and remains unchanged for 2018 and 2020. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.6% in january 2018, unchanged from the previous month, reflecting the impact of the ecb’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth, continuing to expand at a solid annual rate. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is progressing. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations strengthened to 3.4% in january 2018, after 3.1% in december 2017, while the annual growth

the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the asset purchase programme (app) in terms of size and/or duration. the eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. this will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.  incoming information confirms a robust pace of economic expansion, which accelerated more than expected in the second half of 2017. the strong cyclical momentum, the ongoing reduction of economic slack and increasing capacity utilisation strengthen further our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%. at the same time, domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. against this background, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. this continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest

developments in energy prices. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. for their part, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued – in part owing to special factors – and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. yet, looking forward, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.9% in november 2017, after 5.0% in october, reflecting the impact of the ecb’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth, expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in november, after 9.4% in october. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.1% in november 2017, after 2.9% in october, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.8% in november, compared with 2.7% in october. the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2017 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand and a further easing in overall lending

2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the app in terms of size and/or duration. the eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. this will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.  our monetary policy decisions have preserved the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. the incoming information, including our new staff projections, indicates a strong pace of economic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook. the strong cyclical momentum and the significant reduction of economic slack give grounds for greater confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim. at the same time, domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. an ample degree of monetary stimulus therefore remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. this continued monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases that we decided on at our october monetary policy meeting, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the economic expansion in the euro area continued in the third quarter of 2017, when real gdp increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter, after 0.7% in the second quarter. the latest data and survey results point to solid and broad-based growth momentum. our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to support domestic demand. private consumption is underpinned by ongoing employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by rising household wealth. business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and strengthening demand. housing investment has also risen further over recent quarters. in addition, euro area exports are being supported by the broad-based global expansion. this assessment is broadly reflected in the december 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 2.4% in 2017, 2.3% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. compared with the september 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up substantially. risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. on the one hand, the strong cyclical momentum, underpinned by continued positive developments in sentiment indicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises in the near term. on the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.5% in november, up from 1.4% in october. at the same time, measures of underlying inflation have moderated somewhat recently, in part owing to special factors. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to moderate in the coming months, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices, before increasing again. underlying inflation is expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the december 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. compared with the september 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised up, mainly reflecting higher oil and food prices. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 5.0% in october 2017, from 5.2% in september, reflecting the impact of the ecb’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth, expanding at an annual rate of 9.4% in october, after 9.8% in september. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.9% in october 2017, after 2.4% in september, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.7%.  the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing ‒ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises ‒ and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. the implementation of structural reforms in all euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid and broad-based expansion strengthens the case for rebuilding fiscal buffers. this is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. a full, transparent and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. strengthening economic and monetary union remains a priority. the governing council welcomes the ongoing discussions on completing the banking union and the capital markets union, and on further enhancing the institutional

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2017/html/ecb.is171026.en.html,26 October 2017,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, today we conducted a thorough assessment of the outlook for inflation, the risks surrounding this outlook and our monetary policy stance. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective. first, the key ecb interest rates were kept unchanged and we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. second, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (app) at the current monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of december 2017. from january 2018 our net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of september 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the app in terms of size and/or duration. third, the eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. this will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. and fourth, we also decided to continue to conduct the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019. today’s monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. the recalibration of our asset purchases reflects growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation rates towards our inflation aim, on account of the increasingly robust and broad-based economic expansion, an uptick in measures of underlying inflation and the continued effective pass-through of our policy measures to the financing conditions of the real economy. at the same time, domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy. therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. this continued monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the economic expansion in the euro area continues to be solid and broad-based. real gdp increased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017, after 0.6% in the first quarter. the latest data and survey results point to unabated growth momentum in the second half of this year. our monetary policy measures have facilitated the deleveraging process and continue to support domestic demand. private consumption is underpinned by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. the upswing in business investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. construction investment has also strengthened. in addition, the broad-based global recovery is supporting euro area exports. risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. on the one hand, the strong cyclical momentum, as evidenced in recent developments in sentiment indicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises. on the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets. euro area annual hicp inflation remained unchanged at 1.5% in september. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices. at the same time, measures of underlying inflation have ticked up moderately since early 2017, but have yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. wage growth has increased somewhat, but domestic cost pressures still remain subdued overall. underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to continue to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 5.1% in september 2017, after 5.0% in august. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.7% in september 2017, up from 9.5% in august. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.5% in september 2017, after 2.4% in august, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.7%. the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2017 indicates that net loan demand has continued to increase for all loan categories. credit standards have further eased for loans to households, while they remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises. banks’ overall terms and conditions on new loans have continued to ease for all categories of loans. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing ‒ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises ‒ and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to recalibrate the policy instruments to ensure the degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2017/html/ecb.is170907.en.html,7 September 2017,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, are intended to run until the end of december 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. the net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. the incoming information, including our new staff projections, confirms a broadly unchanged medium-term outlook for euro area economic growth and inflation. the economic expansion, which accelerated more than expected in the first half of 2017, continues to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors. at the same time, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. while the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, it has yet to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics. measures of underlying inflation have ticked up slightly in recent months but, overall, remain at subdued levels. therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. this autumn we will decide on the calibration of our policy instruments beyond the end of the year, taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the first quarter. survey data point to continued broad-based growth in the period ahead. our monetary policy measures are supporting domestic demand and have facilitated the deleveraging process. private consumption is underpinned by employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. the recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. moreover, the broad-based global recovery will support euro area exports.  this assessment is broadly reflected in the september 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 2.2% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019. compared with the june 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up for 2017, reflecting the recent stronger growth momentum, and is broadly unchanged thereafter. risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. on the one hand, the current positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected economic upswing. on the other hand, downside risks continue to exist, primarily relating to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets. euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.5% in august. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices. at the same time, measures of underlying inflation have ticked up moderately in recent months, but have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. domestic cost pressures, notably from labour markets, are still subdued. underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wages. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the september 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. compared with the june 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised down slightly, mainly reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3), despite some monthly volatility, continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.5% in july 2017, after 5.0% in june. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in july 2017, down from 9.7% in june. the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.4% in july 2017, up from 2.0% in

we expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, are intended to run until the end of december 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. the net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under

convergence of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the incoming information confirms a continued strengthening of the economic expansion in the euro area, which has been broadening across sectors and regions. the risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced.  while the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, it has yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics. headline inflation is dampened by the weakness in energy prices. moreover, measures of underlying inflation remain overall at subdued levels. therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the last quarter of 2016. incoming data, notably survey results, continue to point to solid, broad-based growth in the period ahead. the pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and has facilitated the deleveraging process. the recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. private consumption is supported by employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. moreover, the global recovery should increasingly lend support to trade and euro area exports. however, economic growth prospects continue to be dampened by a slow pace of implementation of structural reforms, particularly in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors, notwithstanding ongoing improvements. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are broadly balanced. on the one hand, the current positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected economic upswing. on the other hand, downside risks primarily relating to global factors continue to exist. euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.3% in june, down slightly from 1.4% in may, mainly due to lower energy price inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain around current levels in the coming months. at the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 5.0% in may 2017, after 4.9% in april. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.3% in may 2017, unchanged from april.  the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained stable at 2.4% in may 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans to households increased to 2.6%, from 2.4% in april. the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2017 indicates that credit standards for loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase have further eased and that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2017/html/ecb.is170608.en.html,8 June 2017,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, are intended to run until the end of december 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. the net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. our monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the information that has become available since our last monetary policy meeting in late april confirms a stronger momentum in the euro area economy, which is projected to expand at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected. we consider that the risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced. at the same time, the economic expansion has yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics. so far, measures of underlying inflation continue to remain subdued. therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the last quarter of 2016. incoming data, notably survey results, continue to point to solid, broad-based growth in the period ahead. the pass-through of our monetary policy measures has facilitated the deleveraging process and should continue to support domestic demand. in particular, the recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, are supporting real disposable income and private consumption. moreover, the global recovery is increasingly supporting trade and euro area exports. however, economic growth prospects continue to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms, in particular in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors, notwithstanding ongoing improvements. this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, finalised in late may, which are conditional on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures. these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.9% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019. compared with the march 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised upwards over the projection horizon. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are considered to be broadly balanced. on the one hand, the current positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected economic upswing. on the other hand, downside risks relating to predominantly global factors continue to exist. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.4% in may, following 1.9% in april and 1.5% in march. as expected, the recent volatility in inflation rates was mainly due to energy prices and temporary increases in services prices over the easter period. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain around current levels in the coming months. at the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as unutilised resources are still weighing on domestic price and wage formation. underlying inflation is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.3% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. by comparison with the march 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised downwards, mainly reflecting lower oil prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.9% in april 2017, after 5.3% in march. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.2% in april 2017, after 9.1% in march.  the recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.4% in april 2017, from 2.3% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.4% in april. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing, notably for small and medium-sized enterprises, and, hence, credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth. the implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost productivity and potential output growth. regarding fiscal policies, all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. a full, transparent and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact and of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate

we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the new monthly pace of €60 billion, are intended to run until the end of december 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. the net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. our monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. incoming data since our meeting in early march confirm that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy is becoming increasingly solid and that downside risks have further diminished. at the same time, underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued and have yet to show a convincing upward trend. moreover, the ongoing volatility in headline inflation underlines the need to look through transient developments in hicp inflation, which have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2016, following a growth rate of 0.4% in the third quarter. incoming data, notably survey results, bolster our confidence that the ongoing economic expansion will continue to firm and broaden. the pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and facilitates the ongoing deleveraging process. the recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, are supporting real disposable income and private consumption. moreover, the signs of a stronger global recovery and increasing global trade suggest that foreign demand should increasingly add to the overall resilience of the economic expansion in the euro area. however, economic growth continues to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms, in particular in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, while moving towards a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. headline inflation has been recovering from the very low levels seen in 2016, largely owing to higher energy price increases. after reaching 2.0% in february 2017, euro area annual hicp inflation stood at 1.5% in march. this reflected mainly lower energy and unprocessed food price inflation, but also a decline in services price inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to increase in april and thereafter to hover around current levels until the end of this year. however, as unutilised resources are still weighing on domestic wage and price formation, measures of underlying inflation remain low and are expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.7% in february 2017, after 4.8% in january. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.4% in february 2017, unchanged from the previous month.  the recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations declined to 2.0% in february 2017, from 2.3% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly stable at 2.3% in february. at the same time, the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2017 indicates that net loan demand has increased and bank lending conditions have further eased across all loan categories. the pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very

indicators suggest that the cyclical recovery may be gaining momentum. headline inflation has again increased, largely on account of rising energy and food price inflation. however, underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued. the governing council will continue to look through changes in hicp inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term

economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors.  this assessment is broadly reflected in the march 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.8% in 2017, by 1.7% in 2018 and by 1.6% in 2019.

growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation increased further to 2.0% in february, up from 1.8% in january 2017 and 1.1% in december 2016. this reflected mainly a strong increase in annual energy and unprocessed food price inflation, with no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. headline inflation is likely to remain at levels close to 2% in the coming months, largely reflecting movements in the annual rate of

programme. these decisions will be published in a separate press release at 15.30 cet. the monetary policy decisions taken in december 2016 have succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. borrowing conditions for firms and households continue to benefit from the pass-through of our measures. as expected, headline inflation has increased lately, largely owing to base effects in energy prices, but underlying inflation pressures remain subdued. the governing council will continue to look through changes in hicp inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.  a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is needed for euro area inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. if warranted to achieve its objective, the governing council will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. in particular, if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2016, after recording a similar pace of growth in the second quarter. incoming data, notably survey results, point to somewhat stronger growth in the last quarter of 2016. looking ahead, we expect the economic expansion to firm further. the pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and facilitating the ongoing deleveraging process. the very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote the recovery in investment. moreover, sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, provide support for private consumption via increases in households’ real disposable income. at the same time, there are signs of a somewhat stronger global recovery. however, economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation increased markedly from 0.6% in november 2016 to 1.1% in december. this reflected mainly a strong increase in annual energy inflation, while there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation is likely to pick up further in the near term, largely reflecting movements in the annual rate of change of energy prices. however, measures of underlying inflation are expected to rise more gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with its annual rate of growth increasing to 4.8% in november 2016, up from 4.4% in october. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.7% in november, up from 8.0% in october. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations was 2.2% in november 2016, after 2.1% in the previous month. the annual growth rate of loans to households was 1.9% in november, after 1.8% in october. although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 are significantly supporting borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area. the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2016 indicates that credit standards for loans to enterprises are broadly stabilising, while loan demand has continued to expand at a robust pace across all loan categories. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the european level. the implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost investment, productivity and potential output growth in the euro area. structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries. in particular, reforms are needed to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure. in addition, the enhancement of current investment initiatives, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans, are a priority. fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact over time and across countries remains crucial to ensure confidence in the fiscal framework. at the same time,

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is161208.en.html,8 December 2016,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we today conducted a comprehensive assessment of the economic and inflation outlook and our monetary policy stance. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective: as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (app) at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of march 2017. from april 2017, our net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of december 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. if, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, the governing council intends to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. the net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app.  to ensure the continued smooth implementation of the eurosystem’s asset purchases, the governing council decided to adjust the parameters of the app as of january 2017 as follows. first, the maturity range of the public sector purchase programme will be broadened by decreasing the minimum remaining maturity for eligible securities from two years to one year. second, purchases of securities under the app with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the ecb’s deposit facility will be permitted to the extent necessary. the key ecb interest rates were kept unchanged and we continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.  today’s extension of the asset purchase programme has been calibrated to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. together with the sizeable volume of past purchases and forthcoming reinvestments, it ensures that financial conditions in the euro area will remain very favourable, which continues to be crucial to achieve our objective. in particular, the extension of our purchases over a longer horizon allows for a more sustained market presence and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of our stimulus measures. this calibration reflects the moderate but firming recovery of the euro area economy and still subdued underlying inflationary pressures. the governing council will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2016, following similar growth in the second quarter. incoming data, notably survey results, point to a continuation of the growth trend in the fourth quarter of 2016. looking further ahead, we expect the economic expansion to proceed at a moderate but firming pace. the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy is supporting domestic demand and has facilitated deleveraging. improvements in corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions continue to promote a recovery in investment. moreover, sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, provide support for households’ real disposable income and private consumption. at the same time, there are indications of a somewhat stronger global recovery. however, economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors. this assessment is broadly reflected in the december 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.7% in 2016 and 2017, and by 1.6% in 2018 and 2019. compared with the september 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth is broadly unchanged. the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation in november 2016 was 0.6%, up further from 0.5% in october and 0.4% in september. this reflected to a large extent an increase in annual energy inflation, while there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation rates are likely to pick up significantly further at the turn of the year, mainly owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack, inflation rates should increase further in 2018 and 2019. this pattern is also reflected in the december 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. by comparison with the september 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline hicp inflation is broadly unchanged.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) growth moderated in october 2016, with its annual rate of growth decreasing to 4.4%, after 5.1% in september. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 7.9% in october, after 8.4% in september. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.1% in october 2016, from 2.0% in the previous month. the annual growth rate of loans to households remained at 1.8%. although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 are significantly supporting borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to take today’s monetary policy decisions so as to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. as emphasised repeatedly by the governing council, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the european level. the implementation of structural reforms in particular needs to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area. structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries. the focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. the enhancement of current investment initiatives, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans will also contribute positively to this objective. in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact over

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is161020.en.html,20 October 2016,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.  the information that has become available since our meeting in early september confirms a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy and a gradual rise in inflation, in line with our previous expectations. the euro area economy has continued to show resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political uncertainty, aided by our comprehensive monetary policy measures, which ensure very favourable financing conditions for firms and households. overall, however, the baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. looking ahead, we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation which is necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. to that end, we will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate. in december the governing council’s assessment will benefit from the new staff macroeconomic projections extending through to 2019 and from the work of the eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of our purchase programme until march 2017, or beyond, if necessary.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, after 0.5% in the first quarter. the latest data and survey results point to continued growth in the third quarter of 2016, at around the same pace as in the second quarter. looking further ahead, we expect the economic expansion to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. domestic demand should be supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. moreover, still relatively low oil prices and sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and private consumption. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area will be broadly neutral in 2017. however, the economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environment. according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation in september 2016 was 0.4%, up from 0.2% in august. this reflected mainly a continued increase in annual energy inflation, while there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, inflation rates are likely to pick up over the next couple of months, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 2018. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continued to increase at a robust pace in august 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 5.1%, after 4.9% in july. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.9% in august, after 8.4% in july. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 1.9% in august 2016. the annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable, at 1.8%, in august. although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 are significantly supporting borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area.  the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2016 indicates some further improvements in both supply and demand conditions for loans to the non-financial private sector. furthermore, banks continued to report that the ecb’s asset purchase programme and the negative deposit facility rate had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on loans.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. as emphasised repeatedly by the governing council, and as again strongly echoed in both european and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively,

on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans will also contribute positively to this objective. in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth

we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.  today, we assessed the economic and monetary data which had become available since our last meeting and discussed the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections. overall, while the available evidence so far suggests resilience of the euro area economy to the continuing global economic and political uncertainty, our baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks.  our comprehensive policy measures continue to ensure supportive financing conditions and underpin the momentum of the euro area economic recovery. as a result, we continue to expect real gdp to grow at a moderate but steady pace and euro area inflation to rise gradually over the coming months, in line with the path already implied in our june 2016 staff projections.  the governing council will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely. we will preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is embedded in our staff projections and that is necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. if warranted, we will act by using all the instruments available within our mandate. meanwhile, the governing council tasked the relevant committees to evaluate the options that ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, after 0.5% in the first quarter. incoming data point to ongoing growth in the third quarter of 2016, at around the same rate as in the second quarter. looking ahead, we continue to expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. domestic demand remains supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. favourable financing conditions and improvements in the demand outlook and in corporate profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and thus for private consumption. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018. however, the economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the uk referendum outcome, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environment.  this assessment is broadly reflected in the september 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.7% in 2016, by 1.6% in 2017 and by 1.6% in 2018. compared with the june 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised downwards slightly. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation in august 2016 was 0.2%, unchanged from july. while annual energy inflation continued to rise, services and non-energy industrial goods inflation turned out to be slightly lower than in july. looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, inflation rates are likely to remain low over the next few months before starting to pick up towards the end of 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 2018. this pattern is also reflected in the september 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.2% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. in comparison with the june 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation is broadly unchanged.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continued to increase at a robust pace in july 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 4.8%, after 5.0% in june. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.4% in july, after 8.7% in june. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 1.9% in july 2016, compared with 1.7% in june. the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 1.8% in july. although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 are increasingly filtering through to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. as emphasised repeatedly by

accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent

confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. today we discussed developments since our last monetary policy meeting in early june. following the uk referendum on eu membership, our assessment is that euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with encouraging resilience. the announced readiness of central banks to provide liquidity, if needed, and our accommodative monetary policy measures, as well as a robust regulatory and supervisory framework, have all helped to keep market stress contained. financing conditions remain highly supportive, which contributes to a strengthening in credit creation. they continue to support our baseline scenario of an ongoing economic recovery and an increase in inflation rates. at the same time, given prevailing uncertainties, the governing council will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely and to safeguard the pass-through of its accommodative monetary policy to the real economy. over the coming months, when we have more information, including new staff projections, we will be in a better position to reassess the underlying macroeconomic conditions, the most likely paths of inflation and growth, and the distribution of risks around those paths. if warranted to achieve its objective, the governing council will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, after 0.4% in the last quarter of 2015. growth continues to be supported by domestic demand, while export growth has remained modest. incoming data point to ongoing growth in the second quarter of 2016, though at a lower rate than in the first quarter. looking ahead, we continue to expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate pace. domestic demand remains supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and thus for private consumption. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018.  at the same time, headwinds to the economic recovery in the euro area include the outcome of the uk referendum and other geopolitical uncertainties, subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. against this background, the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation in june 2016 was 0.1%, up from -0.1% in may, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely to remain very low in the next few months before starting to pick up later in 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 2018. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continued to increase at a robust pace in may 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 4.9%, after 4.6% in april. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in may, after 9.7% in april. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.4% in may 2016, compared with 1.2% in april. developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained broadly stable at 1.6% in may, after 1.5% in april.  the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2016 indicates further improvements in loan supply conditions for loans to enterprises and households and a continued increase in loan demand across all loan categories. furthermore, banks continued to report that the targeted longer-term refinancing operations had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on loans.  the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 have significantly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. the comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures adopted in march this year underpins the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby supporting the recovery of the real economy. in the light of the prevailing uncertainties, it is essential that the bank lending channel continues to function well. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. as emphasised repeatedly by the governing council, and as again strongly echoed in both european and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the european level. the implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area. structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries, although specific reform needs differ across the individual economies. the focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. the enhancement of current investment initiatives, including the extension of the juncker plan, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans will also contribute positively to this objective. in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in line with the 2016 country-specific recommendations recently approved by the european council, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact over time and across countries is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. at the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide

continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. as a next step, on 8 june we will start making purchases under our corporate sector purchase programme (cspp). moreover, starting on 22 june, we will conduct the first operation in our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations. further information on implementation aspects of the cspp will be released after the press conference on the ecb’s website.  the comprehensive package of decisions taken in early march underpins the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and fosters the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. in particular, our measures continue to ease the cost of credit and contribute to a strengthening in credit creation. the economic recovery is gradually proceeding. additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, is expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented and will contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. in the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting. the governing council will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, after 0.3% in the last quarter of 2015. growth continues to be supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by weak exports. the latest data point to ongoing growth in the second quarter, though possibly at a lower rate than in the first quarter. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. domestic demand remains supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote investment. moreover, sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and private consumption. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary. however, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. this outlook is broadly reflected in the june 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.6% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017 and 2018. compared with the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up for 2016 and has remained broadly unchanged for 2017 and 2018. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but the balance of risks has improved on the back of the monetary policy measures taken and the stimulus still in the pipeline. downside risks continue to relate to developments in the global economy, to the upcoming british referendum and to other geopolitical risks. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation in may 2016 was -0.1%, up from -0.2% in april, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely to remain very low or negative in the next few months before picking up in the second half of 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018.  this broad pattern is also reflected in the june 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. in comparison with the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised slightly up for 2016, reflecting recent oil price increases, and has remained unchanged for 2017 and 2018.  turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continued to grow at a robust pace in april 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 4.6%, after 5.0% in march. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 is mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 9.7% in april, after 10.1% in march. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 1.2% in april 2016, compared with 1.1% in march. developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained broadly stable at 1.5% in april, after 1.6% in march.  the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is160421.en.html,21 April 2016,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, as decided on 10 march 2016, we have started to expand our monthly purchases under the asset purchase programme to €80 billion, from the previous amount of €60 billion. as stated before, these purchases are intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. moreover, in june, we will conduct the first operation of our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro ii) and we will commence purchases under our corporate sector purchase programme (cspp). further information on the implementation aspects of the cspp will be released after the press conference on the ecb’s website. following our comprehensive package of decisions taken in early march, broad financing conditions in the euro area have improved. the pass-through of the monetary policy stimulus to firms and households, notably through the banking system, is strengthening. however, global uncertainties persist.  looking forward, it is essential to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation as long as needed in order to underpin the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and in order to accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. the governing council will continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. in the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015, supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by relatively weak export trends. incoming data for the first quarter of 2016 point to ongoing output growth, at a pace broadly similar to that in the final quarter of 2015. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed. domestic demand, in particular, continues to be supported by our monetary policy measures. their favourable impact on financing conditions, together with improvements in corporate profitability, is benefiting investment. moreover, our accommodative monetary policy stance, continued employment gains resulting from past structural reforms and the still relatively low price of oil should provide ongoing support for households’ real disposable income and private consumption. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary. at the same time, the economic recovery in the euro area is still dampened by the ongoing balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors, the insufficient pace of implementation of structural reforms and subdued growth prospects in emerging markets. the risks to the euro area growth outlook still remain tilted to the downside. our recent monetary policy decisions have improved overall financing conditions, which should support the outlook for consumption and investment. however, uncertainties persist and relate, in particular, to developments in the global economy and to geopolitical risks. according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation in march 2016 was 0.0%, compared with -0.2% in february, reflecting mainly a rise in services price inflation. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for energy, inflation rates could turn negative again in the coming months before picking up in the second half of 2016. thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018. turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (m3) continued to grow at a robust pace in february 2016, with its annual rate of growth remaining unchanged at 5.0%. as in previous months, annual growth in m3 is mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 10.3% in february, after 10.5% in january. loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in february 2016, up from 0.6% in january. developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.6% in february 2016, from 1.4% in january.  the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2016 indicates further improvements in loan supply conditions for enterprises and in loan demand across all loan categories. improvements in the demand for bank loans were supported by the low level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects.  overall, the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. the comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures adopted in march this year underpins the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby supporting the recovery of the real economy.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. as emphasised repeatedly by the governing council, and as strongly echoed in both european and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the european levels. structural policies are essential, given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area. in particular, actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. at the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged continue expect remain present low level

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is160310.en.html,10 March 2016,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough review of the monetary policy stance, in which we also took into account the new macroeconomic projections by our staff extending into the year 2018. as a result, the governing council has decided on a set of measures in the pursuit of its price stability objective. this comprehensive package will exploit the synergies between the different instruments and has been calibrated to further ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%.  first, as regards the key ecb interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by 5 basis points to 0.00% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 5 basis points to 0.25%. the rate on the deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis points to -0.40%.  second, we decided to expand the monthly purchases under our asset purchase programme from €60 billion at present to €80 billion. they are intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. to ensure the continued smooth implementation of our asset purchases, we also decided to increase the issuer and issue share limits for the purchases of securities issued by eligible international organisations and multilateral development banks from 33% to 50%. third, we decided to include investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area in the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases under a new corporate sector purchase programme. this will further strengthen the pass-through of our asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy. purchases under the new programme will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year. fourth, we decided to launch a new series of four targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro ii), starting in june 2016, each with a maturity of four years. these new operations will reinforce the ecb’s accommodative monetary policy stance and will strengthen the transmission of monetary policy by further incentivising bank lending to the real economy. counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 31 january 2016. the interest rate under tltro ii will be fixed over the life of each operation, at the rate on the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations prevailing at the time of take-up. for banks whose net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied to the tltro ii will be lower, and can be as low as the interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing at the time of take-up. there will be no requirement for mandatory early repayments under tltro ii, and switches from tltro i will be allowed. finally, looking ahead, taking into account the current outlook for price stability, the governing council expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the governing council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 cet.  adding to the measures taken since june 2014, with today’s comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions we are providing substantial monetary stimulus to counteract heightened risks to the ecb’s price stability objective. while very low or even negative inflation rates are unavoidable over the next few months, as a result of movements in oil prices, it is crucial to avoid second-round effects by securing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. the governing council will continue to monitor very closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability over the period ahead.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the 
economic analysis. euro area real gdp growth was confirmed at 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015, supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by a negative contribution from net exports. the most recent survey data point to weaker than expected growth momentum at the beginning of this year. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate pace. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by continued employment gains benefiting from past structural reforms. moreover, the low price of oil should provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and private consumption, as well as corporate profitability and investment. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary, partly reflecting measures in support of refugees. however, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. this outlook is broadly reflected in the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.4% in 2016, 1.7% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. compared with the december 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised slightly down, mainly reflecting the weakened growth prospects for the global economy. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. they relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy, as well as to broader geopolitical risks. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was -0.2% in february 2016, compared with 0.3% in january. all main hicp components contributed to this decline. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for energy, inflation rates are expected to remain at negative levels in the coming months and to pick up later in 2016. thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further. the governing council will closely monitor price-setting behaviour and wage developments in the euro area, paying particular attention to ensure that the current low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting. this broad pattern is also reflected in the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.1% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. in comparison with the december 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised down, mainly reflecting the fall in oil prices over recent months. turning to the 
monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (m3), with the annual rate of growth of m3 standing at 5.0% in january 2016, after 4.7% in december 2015. annual growth in m3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 10.5% in january, after 10.8% in december. loan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.6% in january 2016, up from 0.1% in december 2015. developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained stable at 1.4% in january 2016. overall, the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a 
cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary stimulus in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective 
structural policies. in particular, actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. as indicated by the european commission, the implementation of country-specific recommendations continued to be fairly limited in 2015; reform efforts thus need to be stepped up in the majority of euro area countries. 
fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. at the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies",base regular economic monetary_analysis

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is160121.en.html,21 January 2016,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and after the recalibration of our monetary policy measures last month, we decided to keep the 
key ecb interest rates unchanged and we expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. regarding our 
non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchases are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households.  taking stock of the evidence available at the beginning of 2016, it is clear that the monetary policy measures that we have adopted since mid-2014 are working. as a result, developments in the real economy, credit provision and financing conditions have improved and have strengthened the euro area’s resilience to recent global economic shocks. the decisions taken in early december to extend our monthly net asset purchases of €60 billion to at least the end of march 2017, and to reinvest the principal payments on maturing securities for as long as necessary, were fully appropriate. they will result in a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system and will strengthen our forward guidance on interest rates.  yet, as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies’ growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets, and geopolitical risks. in this environment, euro area inflation dynamics also continue to be weaker than expected. it will therefore be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early march, when the new staff macroeconomic projections become available which will also cover the year 2018. in the meantime, work will be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions are in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation, if needed. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the 
economic analysis. euro area real gdp growth was confirmed at 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, supported mainly by private consumption, while being dampened by a negative contribution from net exports. the most recent survey indicators, available up to december, point to ongoing real gdp growth momentum in the fourth quarter of last year. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the earlier progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, the renewed fall in oil prices should provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, for private consumption and investment. in addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is becoming slightly expansionary, reflecting in particular measures in support of refugees. however, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside and relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy, as well as to broader geopolitical risks. these risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.2% in december 2015, compared with 0.1% in november. the december outcome was lower than expected, mainly reflecting the renewed sharp decline in oil prices, as well as lower food price and services price inflation. on the basis of current oil futures prices, which are well below the level observed a few weeks ago, the expected path of annual hicp inflation in 2016 is now significantly lower compared with the outlook in early december. inflation rates are currently expected to remain at very low or negative levels in the coming months and to pick up only later in 2016. thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should continue to recover, but risks of second-round effects should be monitored closely. a more comprehensive picture of the impact of oil prices and other external and domestic factors on the outlook for hicp inflation will become available in the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, which will also cover the year 2018. turning to the 
monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (m3), with the annual rate of growth of m3 standing at 5.1% in november 2015, after 5.3% in october. annual growth in m3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 11.2% in november, after 11.8% in october. loan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in november 2015, up from 0.6% in october. developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.4% in november, compared with 1.2% in october.  the bank lending survey for the euro area for the fourth quarter of 2015 points to further improvements in demand for bank loans, supported by the low level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects. credit standards eased further on loans to enterprises, notably owing to increasing competitive pressures in retail banking, and reverted to a net easing on loans to households for house purchase. overall, the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for both firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a 
cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures in place and the need to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early march in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective 
structural policies. in particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the beneficial effects of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks.

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is151203.en.html,3 December 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we today conducted a thorough assessment of the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term and re-examined the degree of monetary accommodation. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective:  first, as regards the 
key ecb interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.30%. the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.05% and 0.30% respectively.   second, as regards 
non-standard monetary policy measures, we decided to extend the asset purchase programme (app). the monthly purchases of €60 billion under the app are now intended to run until the end of march 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the governing council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. third, we decided to 
reinvest the principal payments on the securities purchased under the app as they mature, for as long as necessary. this will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. the technical details will be communicated in due time. fourth, we decided to include, in the public sector purchase programme, 
euro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by regional and local governments located in the euro area in the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases by the respective national central banks.  fifth, we decided to continue conducting the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations as 
fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2017.  today’s decisions were taken in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations. the latest staff projections incorporate the favourable financial market developments following our last monetary policy meeting. they still indicate continued downside risks to the inflation outlook and slightly weaker inflation dynamics than previously expected. this follows downward revisions in earlier projection exercises. the persistence of low inflation rates reflects sizeable economic slack weighing on domestic price pressures and headwinds from the external environment.  our new measures will ensure accommodative financial conditions and further strengthen the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since june 2014, which have had significant positive effects on financing conditions, credit and the real economy. today’s decisions also reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks. the governing council will closely monitor the evolution in the outlook for price stability and, if warranted, is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. in particular, the governing council recalls that the app provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the 
economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter, most likely on account of a continued positive contribution from consumption alongside more muted developments in investment and exports. the most recent survey indicators point to ongoing real gdp growth in the final quarter of the year. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the earlier progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, low oil prices should provide support for households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. in addition, government expenditure is likely to increase in some parts of the euro area, reflecting measures in support of refugees. however, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets and moderate global trade, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. this outlook is broadly reflected in the december 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. compared with the september 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the prospects for real gdp growth are broadly unchanged. the risks to the euro area growth outlook relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy as well as to broader geopolitical risks. these risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.1% in november 2015, unchanged from october but lower than expected. this reflected somewhat weaker price increases in services and industrial goods, mainly compensated for by a less negative contribution from energy prices. on the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual hicp inflation rates are expected to rise at the turn of the year, mainly on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. during 2016 and 2017, inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further, supported by our previous monetary policy measures – and supplemented by those announced today – the expected economic recovery, and the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate. the governing council will closely monitor the evolution of inflation rates over the period ahead.  this broad pattern is also reflected in the december 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.0% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017. in comparison with the september 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised down slightly. turning to the 
monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (m3), with the annual rate of growth of m3 increasing to 5.3% in october 2015 from 4.9% in september. annual growth in m3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 11.8% in october, after 11.7% in september. loan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.6% in october, up from 0.1% in september. despite these improvements, developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.2% in october, compared with 1.1% in september. overall, the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for both firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a 
cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary stimulus in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. in particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. the swift and effective implementation of

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is151022.en.html,22 October 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, the governing council decided to keep the 
key ecb interest rates unchanged. as regards 
non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchases are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. the governing council has been closely monitoring incoming information since our meeting in early september. while euro area domestic demand remains resilient, concerns over growth prospects in emerging markets and possible repercussions for the economy from developments in financial and commodity markets continue to signal downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. most notably, the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term require thorough analysis. in this context, the degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our december monetary policy meeting, when the new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections will be available. the governing council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate if warranted in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. in particular, the governing council recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration. in the meantime, we will continue to fully implement the monthly asset purchases of €60 billion. these purchases are intended to run until the end of september 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail, starting with the 
economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.5% in the previous quarter. the outcome for the second quarter reflected positive contributions from both domestic demand and net exports. the most recent survey indicators point to a broadly similar pace of real gdp growth in the third quarter of the year. overall, we expect the economic recovery to continue, albeit dampened, in particular, by weaker than expected foreign demand. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, the decline in oil prices should provide support for households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. however, the recovery in domestic demand in the euro area continues to be hampered by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside, reflecting in particular the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in emerging market economies, which have the potential to further weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports. increased uncertainty has recently manifested itself in financial market developments, which may have negative repercussions for euro area domestic demand. according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation was -0.1% in september 2015, down from 0.1% in august. compared with the previous month, this mainly reflects a further decline in energy price inflation. on the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual hicp inflation rates will remain very low in the near term. annual hicp inflation is expected to rise at the turn of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further during 2016 and 2017, supported by the expected economic recovery, the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead as currently reflected in oil futures markets. however, there are risks stemming from the economic outlook and from financial and commodity market developments which could further slow down the gradual increase in inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. these risks are being closely monitored by the governing council. turning to the 
monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (m3), notwithstanding a decline in the annual growth rate of m3 to 4.8% in august 2015 from 5.3% in july. annual growth in m3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 11.4% in august, after 12.2% in july. loan dynamics continued to improve. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.4% in august, up from 0.3% in july, pursuing its gradual recovery since the beginning of 2014. despite these improvements, developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.0% in august 2015, compared with 0.9% in july. the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2015 confirms the increase in demand for bank loans, supported by the general level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects. in addition, credit standards eased further on loans to enterprises, notably due to increasing competitive pressures in retail banking, while tightening somewhat on loans to households for house purchase. overall, the monetary policy measures we have put in place since june 2014 provide clear support for improvements both in borrowing conditions for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a 
cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates the need to firmly implement the governing council’s monetary policy decisions and to monitor closely all relevant incoming information as concerns their impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective 
structural policies. in particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the benefits of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks. 
fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the eu’s fiscal rules. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact is crucial for confidence in our fiscal framework. at the same time, all countries should strive for a growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies",base regular economic monetary_analysis line forward guidance

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is150903.en.html,3 September 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analysis, and in line with our forward guidance, the governing council decided to keep the 
key ecb interest rates unchanged. our asset purchase programme continues to proceed smoothly. regarding 
non-standard monetary policy measures, following the announced review of the public sector purchase programme’s issue share limit after the first six months of purchases, the governing council decided to increase the issue share limit from the initial limit of 25% to 33%, subject to a case-by-case verification that this would not create a situation whereby the eurosystem would have blocking minority power, in which case the issue share limit would remain at 25%.  underlying our monetary policy assessment was a review of recent data, new staff macroeconomic projections and an interim evaluation of recent market fluctuations. the information available indicates a continued though somewhat weaker economic recovery and a slower increase in inflation rates compared with earlier expectations. more recently, renewed downside risks have emerged to the outlook for growth and inflation. however, owing to sharp fluctuations in financial and commodity markets, the governing council judged it premature to conclude on whether these developments could have a lasting impact on the outlook for prices and on the achievement of a sustainable path of inflation towards our medium-term aim, or whether they should be considered to be mainly transitory.  accordingly, the governing council will closely monitor all relevant incoming information. it emphasises its willingness and ability to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate and, in particular, recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the programme.  in the meantime, we will fully implement our monthly asset purchases of €60 billion. these purchases have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. they are intended to run until the end of september 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail, starting with the 
economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015, which was somewhat lower than previously expected. the latest survey indicators point to a broadly similar pace of real gdp growth in the second half of this year. overall, we expect the economic recovery to continue, albeit at a somewhat weaker pace than earlier expected, reflecting in particular the slowdown in emerging market economies, which is weighing on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, the decline in oil prices should provide support for households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. however, economic growth in the euro area is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the september 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.4% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. compared with the june 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down, primarily due to lower external demand owing to weaker growth in emerging markets. the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside, reflecting in particular the heightened uncertainties related to the external environment. notably, current developments in emerging market economies have the potential to further affect global growth adversely via trade and confidence effects. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.2% in august 2015, unchanged from june and july. compared with the previous month, this reflects a further decline in energy price inflation, compensated for by higher price increases for food and industrial goods. on the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual hicp inflation rates will remain very low in the near term. annual hicp inflation is expected to rise towards the end of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further during 2016 and 2017, supported by the expected economic recovery, the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead as currently reflected in oil futures markets. however, this increase in annual inflation rates is currently expected to materialise somewhat more slowly than anticipated thus far. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the september 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.1% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. in comparison with the june 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised down, largely owing to lower oil prices. taking into account the most recent developments in oil prices and recent exchange rates, there are downside risks to the september staff inflation projections.  in this context, the governing council will closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on global economic, financial, commodity price and exchange rate developments.  turning to the 
monetary analysis, recent data confirm robust growth in broad money (m3). the annual growth rate of m3 was 5.3% in july 2015, compared with 4.9% in june. annual growth in m3 continues to be increasingly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 12.1% in july, compared with 11.7% in june. loan dynamics continued to improve. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in july, up from 0.2% in june, continuing its gradual recovery since the beginning of 2014. despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued. they continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.9% in july 2015, after 1.7% in june. overall, the monetary policy measures we have put in place since june 2014 provide clear support for improvements both in borrowing conditions for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a 
cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates the need to firmly implement the governing council’s monetary policy decisions and to monitor closely all relevant incoming information as concerns their impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability.  monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is150716.en.html,16 July 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the 
key ecb interest rates unchanged. regarding 
non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchase programmes continue to proceed smoothly. as explained on previous occasions, our monthly asset purchases of €60 billion are intended to run until the end of september 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. when carrying out its assessment, the governing council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation and the medium-term outlook for price stability.  all in all, the information that has become available since the governing council meeting in early june has been broadly in line with our expectations. recent developments in financial markets, which partly reflect greater uncertainty, have not changed the governing council’s assessment of a broadening of the euro area’s economic recovery and a gradual increase in inflation rates over the coming years. the ecb’s monetary policy stance remains accommodative and market-based inflation expectations have, on balance, stabilised or recovered further since our meeting in early june. the latest information also remains consistent with a continued pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. our measures thereby continue to contribute to economic growth, a reduction in economic slack, and money and credit expansion. the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, and will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations.  looking ahead, we will continue to closely monitor the situation in financial markets, as well as the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the outlook for price stability. if any factors were to lead to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, or if the outlook for price stability were to materially change, the governing council would respond to such a situation by using all the instruments available within its mandate.  let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail, starting with the 
economic analysis. euro area quarterly real gdp growth was confirmed at 0.4% in the first quarter of 2015, supported by contributions from private consumption and investment. the latest survey data, available up to june, remain consistent with a continuation of the moderate growth trend in the second quarter. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden further. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, the recent decline in oil prices should provide additional support for households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness. however, the ongoing slowdown in emerging market economies continues to weigh on the global outlook and economic growth in the euro area is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. the downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area have generally been contained as a result of our monetary policy decisions, as well as oil price and exchange rate developments.  inflation bottomed out at the beginning of the year and has moved back into positive territory in recent months. according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.2% in june 2015, slightly down from 0.3% in may. on the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain low in the months ahead and to rise towards the end of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. supported by the expected economic recovery, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption embedded in oil futures markets of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to pick up further during 2016 and 2017. the governing council will continue to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on geopolitical, energy and exchange rate developments.  turning to the 
monetary analysis, recent data confirm robust growth in broad money (m3). the annual growth rate of m3 was 5.0% in may 2015, compared with 5.3% in april. annual growth in m3 continues to be strongly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 11.2% in may. loan dynamics continued to improve. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.1% in may, up from -0.1% in april, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in february 2014. this is consistent with the positive evidence from the bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2015. banks reported a continued net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises which was stronger than expected in the previous survey round. net demand for loans to enterprises increased further, supported by demand for credit related to fixed investment. fragmentation in terms of credit demand in individual countries decreased and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations helped to improve the terms and conditions for credit supply. despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued. they continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.4% in may 2015, after 1.3% in april. overall, the monetary policy measures we have put in place since june 2014 provide clear support for improvements both in borrowing conditions for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a 
cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to maintain a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing the governing council’s monetary policy decisions. the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the economic recovery in the euro area and lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective 
structural policies. in particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the implementation of 
product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. a swift and effective implementation of these reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes.

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is150603.en.html,3 June 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchase programmes are proceeding well. as explained on previous occasions, our asset purchases of €60 billion per month are intended to run until the end of september 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. when carrying out its assessment, the governing council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through fluctuations in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. our monetary policy measures have contributed to a broad-based easing in financial conditions, a recovery in inflation expectations and more favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households. the effects of these measures are working their way through to the economy and are contributing to economic growth, a reduction in economic slack, and money and credit expansion. the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the euro area economy, lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, and underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. in the first quarter of 2015, real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, after 0.3% in the last quarter of 2014. in recent quarters, domestic demand and, particularly, private consumption were the main drivers behind the ongoing recovery. the latest survey data to may remain consistent with a continuation of the modest growth trend in the second quarter. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden. domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, the low level of the price of oil should continue to support households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness. however, economic growth in the euro area is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017. compared with the march 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real gdp growth over the projection horizon remain virtually unchanged. while remaining on the downside, the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area have become more balanced on account of our monetary policy decisions and oil price and exchange rate developments. inflation bottomed out at the beginning of the year. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.3% in may 2015, up from 0.0% in april and compared with -0.6% in january. on the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain low in the months ahead and to rise towards the end of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. supported by the expected economic recovery, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption embedded in oil futures markets of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to pick up further during 2016 and 2017. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.3% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. in comparison with the march 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the inflation projections have been revised upwards for 2015 and remain unchanged for 2016 and 2017. the governing council will continue to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments. we acknowledge that the staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures in place. we also take into account that the degree of forecast uncertainty tends to increase with the length of the projection horizon. turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the increase in underlying growth in broad money (m3). the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 5.3% in april 2015, up from 4.6% in march. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 10.5% in april. loan dynamics gradually improved further. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.1% in april, after -0.2% in march, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in february 2014. despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued. they continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased further to 1.3% in april 2015, after 1.1% in march. the monetary policy measures we have put in place will support further improvements both in borrowing costs for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to maintain a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing the governing council’s monetary policy decisions. the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the economic recovery in the euro area and lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. in particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. a swift and effective implementation of these reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes. therefore, it will encourage both households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment today, thus reinforcing the current cyclical economic recovery. as concerns fiscal developments, reflecting mainly the cyclical recovery and the low level of interest rates, the aggregate euro area general government deficit ratio is projected to decline gradually from 2.1% of gdp this year to 1.5% in 2017. the general government debt ratio is projected to decline gradually from 91.5% of gdp this year to 88.4% in 2017. fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the stability and growth pact. full and consistent implementation of the pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework",base regular economic monetary_analysis line forward guidance decide key_interest_rate unchanged regard non standard monetary_policy measure

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is150415.en.html,15 April 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged.  as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, on 9 march we started purchasing euro-denominated public sector securities as part of our expanded asset purchase programme, which also comprises purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds. purchases are intended to run until the end of september 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. when carrying out its assessment, the governing council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through unexpected outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.  the implementation of our asset purchase programmes is proceeding smoothly, with volumes in line with the announced figure of €60 billion of securities per month. in addition, there is clear evidence that the monetary policy measures we have put in place are effective. financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private sector have eased considerably over the past months and borrowing conditions for firms and households have improved notably, with a pick-up in the demand for credit.  looking ahead, our focus will be on the full implementation of our monetary policy measures. through these measures, we will contribute to a further improvement in the economic outlook, a reduction in economic slack and a recovery in money and credit growth. together, such developments will lead to a sustained return of inflation towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2014. domestic demand, especially private consumption, continued to be the main driver behind the ongoing recovery. the latest economic indicators, including survey data up to march, suggest that the euro area economy has gained further momentum since the end of 2014. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden and strengthen gradually. domestic demand should be further supported by ongoing improvements in financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, the lower level of the price of oil should continue to support households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness. however, the euro area recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. while remaining on the downside, the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area have become more balanced on account of the recent monetary policy decisions, the fall in oil prices and the lower euro exchange rate. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was -0.1% in march 2015, up from -0.3% in february and -0.6% in january. this pattern largely reflects an increase in oil prices in euro terms since mid-january. on the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain very low or still negative in the months ahead. supported by the favourable impact of our monetary policy measures on aggregate demand, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption of base effects and somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase later in 2015 and to pick up further during 2016 and 2017.  the governing council will continue to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments. turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the gradual increase in underlying growth in broad money (m3). the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 4.0% in february 2015, up from 3.7% in january. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 9.1% in february. loan dynamics also gradually improved further. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.4% in february, after -0.9% in january, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in february 2014. in this respect, the april 2015 bank lending survey confirms that improvements in lending conditions support a further recovery in loan growth, in particular for firms. despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued and continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased further to 1.0% in february 2015, after 0.9% in january. the monetary policy measures we have put in place should support further improvements both in borrowing costs for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to implement firmly the governing council’s recent decisions. the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective supply-side measures. in particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. a swift and effective implementation of these reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and encourage both households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment today, thus reinforcing the current economic recovery. fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the stability and growth pact. full and consistent implementation of the pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework. in view of the necessity to step up structural reform efforts in a number of countries, it is also important that the macroeconomic imbalance procedure is implemented effectively in order to address the excessive imbalances as identified in individual member states",base regular economic monetary_analysis line forward guidance decide key_interest_rate

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is150305.en.html,5 March 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the focus is now on implementation. following up on our decisions of 22 january 2015, we will, on 9 march 2015, start purchasing euro-denominated public sector securities in the secondary market. we will also continue purchasing asset-backed securities and covered bonds, which we started last year. as previously stated, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector securities will amount to €60 billion. they are intended to be carried out until the end of september 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. further information on certain implementation aspects of the public sector purchase programme will be released at 3.30 p.m. cet on the ecb’s website. we have already seen a significant number of positive effects from these monetary policy decisions. financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private economy have eased further, also following our previous monetary policy measures. in particular, borrowing conditions for firms and households have improved considerably. moreover, money and credit dynamics have been firming.  the substantial additional easing of our monetary policy stance supports and reinforces the emergence of more favourable developments for the euro area economy. in an environment of improving business and consumer sentiment, the transmission of our measures to the real economy will strengthen, contributing to a further improvement in the outlook for economic growth and a reduction in economic slack. thereby, our measures will contribute to a sustained return of inflation towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2014, which was somewhat higher than previously expected. the latest economic data and, particularly, survey evidence available up to february point to some further improvements in economic activity at the beginning of this year. looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden and strengthen gradually. the low level of the price of oil should continue to support households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability. domestic demand should also be further supported by our monetary policy measures leading to ongoing improvements in financial conditions, as well as by the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. moreover, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness and from the global recovery. however, the euro area recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in various sectors and the rather slow pace of implementation of structural reforms.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017. compared with the december 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real gdp growth in 2015 and 2016 have been revised upwards, reflecting the favourable impact of lower oil prices, the weaker effective exchange rate of the euro and the impact of the ecb’s recent monetary policy measures. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside but have diminished following recent monetary policy decisions and the fall in oil prices.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was -0.3 % in february 2015, after -0.6% in january. the negative outcomes largely reflect the impact of the significant fall in oil prices since july 2014. on the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for oil, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain very low or negative in the months ahead. supported by the favourable impact of our recent monetary policy measures on aggregate demand, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to start increasing gradually later in 2015.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.0% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. in comparison with the december 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the inflation projection for 2015 has been revised downwards, mainly reflecting the fall in oil prices. in contrast, the inflation projection for 2016 has been revised slightly upwards, also reflecting the expected impact of our recent monetary policy measures. the governing council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, geopolitical developments, and exchange rate and energy price developments.  when discussing the economic outlook and the new projections, the governing council acknowledged that the staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all our policy measures. moreover, the march staff projections extend the horizon to 2017. in this context, the governing council again stressed that the degree of forecast uncertainty tends to increase with the length of the projection horizon.  turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the gradual increase in underlying growth in broad money (m3). the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 4.1% in january 2015, up from 3.8% in december 2014. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 9.0% in january. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.9% in january 2015, after -1.1% in december 2014, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in february 2014. the three-month cumulated net lending flows were positive in january for the second consecutive month, compared with sizeable net redemptions still recorded a year ago. despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued and continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased further to 0.9% in january 2015, after 0.8% in december 2014. our recent monetary policy measures should support a further improvement in credit flows. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the appropriateness of the governing council’s recent decisions. the determined implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. given high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, a cyclical recovery along the lines of the march ecb staff projections is no grounds for complacency. in particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the decisive implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. it is crucial that structural reforms be implemented swiftly, credibly and effectively, as this will not only increase the future sustainable growth of the euro area but also raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today, bringing forward the economic recovery. fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the stability and growth pact. full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework. in view of the necessity to step up structural reform efforts in a number of countries, it is also important that the macroeconomic imbalance procedure is

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is150122.en.html,22 January 2015,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we conducted a thorough reassessment of the outlook for price developments and of the monetary stimulus achieved. as a result, the governing council took the following decisions:  first, it decided to launch an expanded asset purchase programme, encompassing the existing purchase programmes for asset-backed securities and covered bonds. under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector securities will amount to €60 billion. they are intended to be carried out until end-september 2016 and will in any case be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in march 2015 the eurosystem will start to purchase euro-denominated investment-grade securities issued by euro area governments and agencies and european institutions in the secondary market. the purchases of securities issued by euro area governments and agencies will be based on the eurosystem ncbs’ shares in the ecb’s capital key. some additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an eu/imf adjustment programme.  second, the governing council decided to change the pricing of the six remaining targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltros). accordingly , the interest rate applicable to future tltro operations will be equal to the rate on the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations prevailing at the time when each tltro is conducted, thereby removing the 10 basis point spread over the mro rate that applied to the first two tltros.  third, in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged.  as regards the additional asset purchases, the governing council retains control over all the design features of the programme and the ecb will coordinate the purchases, thereby safeguarding the singleness of the eurosystem’s monetary policy. the eurosystem will make use of decentralised implementation to mobilise its resources. with regard to the sharing of hypothetical losses, the governing council decided that purchases of securities of european institutions (which will be 12% of the additional asset purchases, and which will be purchased by ncbs) will be subject to loss sharing. the rest of the ncbs’ additional asset purchases will not be subject to loss sharing. the ecb will hold 8% of the additional asset purchases. this implies that 20% of the additional asset purchases will be subject to a regime of risk sharing.  separate press releases with more detailed information on the expanded asset purchase programme and the pricing of the tltros will be published this afternoon at 3.30 p.m.  today’s monetary policy decision on additional asset purchases was taken to counter two unfavourable developments. first, inflation dynamics have continued to be weaker than expected. while the sharp fall in oil prices over recent months remains the dominant factor driving current headline inflation, the potential for second-round effects on wage and price-setting has increased and could adversely affect medium-term price developments. this assessment is underpinned by a further fall in market-based measures of inflation expectations over all horizons and the fact that most indicators of actual or expected inflation stand at, or close to, their historical lows. at the same time, economic slack in the euro area remains sizeable and money and credit developments continue to be subdued. second, while the monetary policy measures adopted between june and september last year resulted in a material improvement in terms of financial market prices, this was not the case for the quantitative results. as a consequence, the prevailing degree of monetary accommodation was insufficient to adequately address heightened risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. thus, today the adoption of further balance sheet measures has become warranted to achieve our price stability objective, given that the key ecb interest rates have reached their lower bound.  looking ahead, today’s measures will decisively underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. the sizeable increase in our balance sheet will further ease the monetary policy stance. in particular, financing conditions for firms and households in the euro area will continue to improve. moreover, today’s decisions will support our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. taken together, these factors should strengthen demand, increase capacity utilisation and support money and credit growth, and thereby contribute to a return of inflation rates towards 2%.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2014. the latest data and survey evidence point to continued moderate growth at the turn of the year. looking ahead, recent declines in oil prices have strengthened the basis for the economic recovery to gain momentum. lower oil prices should support households’ real disposable income and corporate profitability. domestic demand should also be further supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. however, the euro area recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside, but should have diminished after today’s monetary policy decisions and the continued fall in oil prices over recent weeks.  according to eurostat, euro area annual hicp inflation was -0.2% in december 2014, after 0.3% in november. this decline mainly reflects a sharp fall in energy price inflation and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the annual rate of change in food prices. on the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for oil, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain very low or negative in the months ahead. such low inflation rates are unavoidable in the short term, given the recent very sharp fall in oil prices and assuming that no significant correction will take place in the next few months. supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected recovery in demand and the assumption of a gradual increase in oil prices in the period ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase gradually later in 2015 and in 2016.  the governing council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on geopolitical developments, exchange rate and energy price developments, and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures.  turning to the monetary analysis, recent data indicate a pick-up in underlying growth in broad money (m3), although it remains at low levels. the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 3.1% in november 2014, up from 2.5% in october and a trough of 0.8% in april 2014. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 6.9% in november. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained weak at -1.3% in november 2014, compared with -1.6% in october, while continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in february 2014. on average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago and net lending flows turned slightly positive in november. in this respect, the january 2015 bank lending survey indicates a further net easing of credit standards in the fourth quarter of 2014, with cross-country disparities decreasing in parallel with an increase in net demand for loans across all loan categories. banks expect that these dynamics will continue in early 2015. despite these improvements, lending to non-financial corporations remains weak and continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.7% in november, after 0.6% in october. our monetary policy measures should support a further improvement in credit flows. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary policy accommodation. all our monetary policy measures should provide support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates closer to levels below, but close to, 2%.  monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to increase investment activity, boost job creation and raise productivity growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. in particular, the determined implementation of product and labour market reforms as well as actions to improve the business environment for firms needs to gain momentum in several countries. it is crucial that structural reforms be implemented swiftly, credibly and effectively as this will not only increase the future sustainable growth of the euro area, but will also raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward the economic recovery. fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while ensuring debt sustainability in compliance with the stability and growth pact, which remains the anchor for confidence. all countries should use the available scope for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies",base regular economic monetary_analysis conduct thorough reassessment outlook price development

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is141204.en.html,4 December 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. as regards our non-standard monetary policy measures, we have started purchasing covered bonds and asset-backed securities. these purchase programmes will last for at least two years. next week, we will conduct the second targeted longer-term refinancing operation, to be followed by six further operations until june 2016. taken together, our measures will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is intended to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012.  in the coming months, our measures will further ease the monetary policy stance more broadly, support our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. however, the latest euro area macroeconomic projections indicate lower inflation, accompanied by weaker real gdp growth and subdued monetary dynamics. in this context, early next year the governing council will reassess the monetary stimulus achieved, the expansion of the balance sheet and the outlook for price developments. we will also evaluate the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends in the euro area. should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the governing council remains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. this would imply altering early next year the size, pace and composition of our measures. in response to the request of the governing council, ecb staff and the relevant eurosystem committees have stepped up the technical preparations for further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner. all of our monetary policy measures are geared towards underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%, and contribute to a return of inflation rates towards that level.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of this year. this was in line with earlier indications of a weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum, leading to a downward revision of the outlook for euro area real gdp growth in the most recent forecasts. the latest data and survey evidence up to november confirm this picture of a weaker growth profile in the period ahead. at the same time, the outlook for a modest economic recovery remains in place. on the one hand, domestic demand should be supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and significantly lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. on the other hand, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors.  these elements are reflected in the december 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 0.8% in 2014, 1.0% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. compared with the september 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real gdp growth have been revised substantially downwards. downward revisions were made to the projections for both domestic demand and net exports.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area are on the downside. in particular, the weak euro area growth momentum, alongside high geopolitical risks, has the potential to dampen confidence and especially private investment. in addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.3% in november 2014, after 0.4% in october. compared with the previous month, this mainly reflects a stronger fall in energy price inflation and a somewhat lower annual increase in services prices. taking into account the current environment of very low rates of inflation, it will be important to assess the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends and to avoid spillovers to inflation expectations and wage formation.  against the background of recent oil price developments, it is crucial to recall that forecasts and projections are based on technical assumptions, especially for oil prices and exchange rates. on the basis of information available in mid-november, at the time the december 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area were finalised, annual hicp inflation was foreseen to reach 0.5% in 2014, 0.7% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016. in comparison with the september 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, they have been revised significantly downwards. these revisions reflect mainly lower oil prices in euro terms and the impact of the downwardly revised outlook for growth, but they do not yet incorporate the fall in oil prices over the past few weeks following the cut-off date for the projections. over the coming months, annual hicp inflation rates could experience renewed downward movements, given the recent further decline in oil prices. the governing council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate and energy price developments, and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. we will be particularly vigilant as regards the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends in the euro area. turning to the monetary analysis, data for october 2014 support the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3), with the annual growth rate standing at 2.5% in october, unchanged from september. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 6.2% in october.  the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -1.6% in october, after -1.8% in september, showing a gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in february. on average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago. lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.6% in october, after 0.5% in september. the monetary policy measures in place and the completion of the ecb’s comprehensive assessment should support a further stabilisation of credit flows.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term and to be prepared to provide further monetary policy accommodation, if needed.  monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to strengthen investment activity, boost job creation and raise productivity growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. in particular, the determined

the key ecb interest rates unchanged. following up on the decisions of 2 october 2014, we last month started purchasing covered bonds under our new programme. we will also soon start to purchase asset-backed securities. the programmes will last for at least two years. together with the series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until june 2016, these asset purchases will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012.  our measures will enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, support financing conditions in the euro area, facilitate credit provision to the real economy and generate positive spillovers to other markets. they will thereby further ease the monetary policy stance more broadly, support our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies.  with the measures that have been put in place, monetary policy has responded to the outlook for low inflation, a weakening growth momentum and continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics. our accommodative monetary policy stance will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. as they work their way through to the economy, our monetary policy measures will together contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to our aim.  however, looking ahead, and taking into account new information and analysis, the governing council will closely monitor and continuously assess the appropriateness of its monetary policy stance. should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. the governing council has tasked ecb staff and the relevant eurosystem committees with ensuring the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp increased by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of this year, revised up as compared with the earlier estimate. since the summer months, incoming data and survey evidence have overall indicated a weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum. this information has now been incorporated into the most recent forecasts by private and public institutions, which indicate a downward revision of real gdp growth over the projection horizon up to 2016, with the outlook for a modest economic recovery remaining in place. this picture is broadly in line with the governing council’s current assessment. on the one hand, domestic demand should be supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. on the other hand, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. in particular, the weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. in addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.4% in october 2014, after 0.3% in september. compared with the previous month, this mainly reflects a somewhat less negative contribution from energy prices and slightly stronger annual increases in food prices. a fall in industrial goods prices was partly compensated for by an increase in services price inflation. on the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain at around current low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. this is also the picture portrayed by the most recent forecasts, which now incorporate the recent sharp fall in oil prices.  the governing council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate and energy price developments, and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. turning to the monetary analysis, data for september 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3), with the annual growth rate increasing moderately, however, to 2.5% in september, after 2.1% in august. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 6.2% in september. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -1.8% in september, after -2.0% in august and -2.2% in july. on average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago. lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.6% in september, after 0.5% in august. in line with some stabilisation in credit flows, the october bank lending survey for the euro area reported a net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises and households. at the same time, it has to be kept in mind that the level of credit standards is still tight from a historical perspective. following the completion of the ecb’s comprehensive assessment, a further strengthening of banks’ balance sheets can be expected to contribute to reducing credit supply constraints and facilitating more lending.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the recent decisions taken by the governing council to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to strengthen investment activity, boost job creation and raise productivity growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. in particular, the legislation and implementation of product and labour market reforms as well as actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. the effective implementation of structural reforms will raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward the economic recovery. as regards fiscal policies, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances should not unravel the progress already made and should proceed in line with the rules of the stability and growth pact. throughout the procedural steps under the agreed framework, the pact should remain the anchor for confidence in sustainable public finances. the existing flexibility within the rules should allow governments to address the budgetary costs of major structural reforms, to support demand and to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. a full and consistent implementation of the euro area’s existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the resilience of the euro area economy to shocks",base regular economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is141002.en.html,2 October 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. following up on the decisions of 4 september 2014, we also decided on the key operational details of both the asset-backed securities purchase programme and the new covered bond purchase programme.  this will allow us to start purchasing covered bonds and asset-backed securities (abss) in the fourth quarter of 2014, starting with covered bonds in the second half of october. the programmes will last for at least two years. together with the series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until june 2016, these purchases will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet.  the new measures will support specific market segments that play a key role in the financing of the economy. they will thereby further enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, facilitate credit provision to the broad economy and generate positive spillovers to other markets. taking into account the overall subdued outlook for inflation, the weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum over the recent past and the continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics, our asset purchases should ease the monetary policy stance more broadly. they should also strengthen our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies.  together with the monetary accommodation already in place, the determined implementation of the new measures will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. as all our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to our aim. should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate.  a separate press release will provide further information on the modalities of our new purchase programmes for abss and covered bonds. it will be released at 3.30 p.m. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following four quarters of moderate expansion, euro area real gdp remained unchanged between the first and second quarter of this year. survey data available up to september confirm the weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum, while remaining consistent with a modest economic expansion in the second half of the year. looking ahead to 2015, the outlook for a moderate recovery in the euro area remains in place, but the main factors and assumptions shaping this assessment need to be monitored closely. domestic demand should be supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. at the same time, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, continued negative bank loan growth to the private sector, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. in particular, the recent weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. in addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.3% in september 2014, after 0.4% in august. compared with the previous month, this reflects a stronger decline in energy prices and somewhat lower price increases in most other components of the hicp. on the basis of current information, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016.  the governing council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate developments and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. turning to the monetary analysis, data for august 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3), with the annual growth rate increasing moderately to 2.0% in august, after 1.8% in july. annual growth in m3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 growing at an annual rate of 5.8% in august. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -2.0% in august, after -2.2% in the previous month. on average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago. lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in august, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. against the background of weak credit growth, the ecb is now close to finalising the comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets, which is of key importance to overcome credit supply constraints.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the recent decisions taken by the governing council to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy.  monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. however, in order to strengthen investment activity, job creation and potential growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. in particular, the legislation and implementation of structural reforms clearly need to gain momentum in several countries. this applies to product and labour markets as well as to actions to improve the business environment for firms. as regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should not unravel the progress already made and should proceed in line with the rules of the stability and growth pact. this should be reflected in the draft budgetary plans for 2015 that governments will now deliver, in which they will address the relevant country-specific recommendations. the pact should remain the anchor for confidence in sustainable public finances, and the existing flexibility within the rules should allow governments to address the budgetary costs of major structural reforms, to support demand and to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. a full and consistent implementation of the euro area’s existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the euro area’s resilience to

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140904.en.html,4 September 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided today to lower the  interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by 10 basis points to 0.05% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 10 basis points to 0.30%. the rate on the deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis points to -0.20%. in addition, the governing council decided to start purchasing non-financial private sector assets. the eurosystem will purchase a broad portfolio of simple and transparent asset-backed securities (abss) with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector under an abs purchase programme (abspp). this reflects the role of the abs market in facilitating new credit flows to the economy and follows the intensification of preparatory work on this matter, as decided by the governing council in june. in parallel, the eurosystem will also purchase a broad portfolio of euro-denominated covered bonds issued by mfis domiciled in the euro area under a new covered bond purchase programme (cbpp3). interventions under these programmes will start in october 2014. the detailed modalities of these programmes will be announced after the governing council meeting of 2 october 2014. the newly decided measures, together with the targeted longer-term refinancing operations which will be conducted in two weeks, will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet. these decisions will add to the range of monetary policy measures taken over recent months. in particular, they will support our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and reflect the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. they will further enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and support the provision of credit to the broad economy. in our analysis, we took into account the overall subdued outlook for inflation, the weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum over the recent past and the continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics. today’s decisions, together with the other measures in place, have been taken with a view to underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. as our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following four quarters of moderate expansion, euro area real gdp remained unchanged in the second quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter. while it partly reflected one-off factors, this outcome was weaker than expected. with regard to the third quarter, survey data available up to august indicate a loss in cyclical growth momentum, while remaining consistent with a modest expansion.  domestic demand should be supported by the range of our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. at the same time, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, continued negative mfi loan growth to the private sector, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. looking ahead, the key factors and assumptions shaping the outlook for growth need to be monitored closely.  these elements are reflected in the september 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 0.9% in 2014, 1.6% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. compared with the june 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real gdp growth for 2014 and 2015 have been revised downwards and the projection for 2016 has been revised upwards.  the governing council sees the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area on the downside. in particular, the loss in economic momentum may dampen private investment, and heightened geopolitical risks could have a further negative impact on business and consumer confidence. another downside risk relates to insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.3% in august 2014, after 0.4% in july. this decline reflects primarily lower energy price inflation, while the other main components remained broadly unchanged in aggregate. inflation rates have now remained low for a considerable period of time. as said, today’s decisions, together with the other measures in place, have been taken to underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. on the basis of current information, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016.  the september 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.6% in 2014, 1.1% in 2015 and 1.4% in 2016. in comparison with the june 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2014 has been revised downwards. the projections for 2015 and 2016 have remained unchanged. the governing council, taking into account the measures decided today, will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. in this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate developments and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. turning to the monetary analysis, data for july 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3), with annual growth standing at 1.8% in july, compared with 1.6% in june. the growth of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 stood at 5.6% in july, up from 5.4% in june. the increase in the mfi net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, remained an important factor supporting annual m3 growth. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -2.2% in july, unchanged compared with the previous month. however, net redemptions were again sizeable in july. lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in july, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. against the background of weak credit growth, the ecb is finalising the comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets, which is of key importance to overcome credit supply constraints.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis led the governing council to decide on measures to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy.  with regard to structural reforms, important steps have been taken in several member states, while in others such measures still need to be legislated for and implemented. these efforts now clearly need to gain momentum to achieve higher sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. determined structural reforms in product and labour markets as well as action to improve the business environment are warranted. as regards  fiscal policies, comprehensive fiscal consolidation in recent years has contributed to reducing budgetary imbalances. euro area countries should not unravel the progress made with fiscal consolidation and should proceed in line with the stability and growth pact. the pact acts as an anchor for confidence, and the existing flexibility within the rules allows the budgetary costs of major structural reforms to be addressed and demand to be supported. there is also leeway to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. a full and consistent implementation of the euro area’s existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140807.en.html,7 August 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the available information remains consistent with our assessment of a continued moderate and uneven recovery of the euro area economy, with low rates of inflation and subdued monetary and credit dynamics. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. the monetary policy measures decided in early june have led to an easing of the monetary policy stance. this is in line with our forward guidance and adequately reflects the outlook for the euro area economy, as well as the differences in terms of the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltros) that are to take place over the coming months will enhance our accommodative monetary policy stance. these operations will provide long-term funding at attractive terms and conditions over a period of up to four years for all banks that meet certain benchmarks applicable to their lending to the real economy. this should help to ease funding conditions further and stimulate credit provision to the real economy. as our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%.  as stated previously, and as a follow-up to our decision in early june, we have intensified preparatory work related to outright purchases in the asset-backed securities market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  looking ahead, we will maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation. concerning our forward guidance, the key ecb interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation. moreover, the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. we are strongly determined to safeguard the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium to long term.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. in the first quarter of this year euro area real gdp rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter. with regard to the second quarter, monthly indicators have been somewhat volatile, partly reflecting technical factors. overall, recent information, including survey data available for july, remains consistent with our expectation of a continued moderate and uneven recovery of the euro area economy. looking ahead, domestic demand should be supported by a number of factors, including the accommodative monetary policy stance and the ongoing improvements in financial conditions. in addition, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, as well as gains in real disposable income, should make a positive contribution to economic growth. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the ongoing global recovery. however, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. moreover, the annual rate of change of mfi loans to the private sector remained negative in june and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors are likely to continue to dampen the pace of the economic recovery. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. in particular, heightened geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively, including through effects on energy prices and global demand for euro area products. a further downside risk relates to insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker than expected domestic demand. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.4% in july 2014, after 0.5% in june. this reflects primarily lower energy price inflation, while the other main components of the hicp remained broadly unchanged on the basis of current information, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. meanwhile, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  the governing council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. in this context, we will closely monitor the possible repercussions of heightened geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments. turning to the monetary analysis, data for june 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3), with annual growth standing at 1.5% in june, compared with 1.0% in may. the growth of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 stood at 5.3% in june, up from 5.0% in may. the increase in the mfi net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, remained an important factor supporting annual m3 growth. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -2.3% in june, compared with -2.5% in may and ‑3.2% in february. lending to non-financial corporations continues to be weak, reflecting the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. at the same time, in terms of monthly flows, loans to non-financial corporations have shown some signs of a stabilisation over recent months, after recording sizeable negative monthly flows earlier in the year. this is consistent with the results of the bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2014 in which banks reported that credit standards for loans to enterprises had eased in net terms. however, they remain rather tight overall, when seen from a historical perspective. in addition, banks reported an improvement in net loan demand by non-financial corporations and households. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in june, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. against the background of weak credit growth, the ecb’s ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets is of key importance. banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital position, thereby supporting the scope for credit expansion during the next stages of the recovery.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the current low level of inflation should be followed by a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. as regards fiscal policies, comprehensive fiscal consolidation in recent years has contributed to reducing budgetary imbalances. important structural reforms have increased competitiveness and the adjustment capacity of countries’ labour and product markets. these efforts now need to gain momentum to enhance the euro area’s growth potential. structural reforms should focus on fostering private investment and job creation. to restore sound public finances, euro area countries should proceed in line with the stability and growth pact and should not unravel the progress made with fiscal consolidation. fiscal consolidation should be designed in a growth-friendly way. a full and consistent implementation of the euro area’s existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140703.en.html,3 July 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the latest information signals that the euro area economy continued its moderate recovery in the second quarter, with low rates of inflation and subdued monetary and credit growth. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. the combination of monetary policy measures decided last month has already led to a further easing of the monetary policy stance. the monetary operations to take place over the coming months will add to this accommodation and will support bank lending. as our measures work their way through to the economy, they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. concerning our forward guidance, the key ecb interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation. moreover, the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. we are strongly determined to safeguard the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium to long term.  as a follow-up to the decisions taken in early june, the governing council today also decided on specific modalities for the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltros). the aim of the tltros is to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting lending to the real economy. a press release on the modalities for the tltros will be published today at 3.30 p.m. as announced last month, we have also started to intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases in the abs market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of this year. economic indicators, including survey results available up to june, signal a continuation of the very gradual recovery in the second quarter of 2014. looking ahead, domestic demand should be supported by a number of factors, including the further accommodation in the monetary policy stance and the ongoing improvements in financing conditions. in addition, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, as well as gains in real disposable income, should make a positive contribution to economic growth. furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the ongoing global recovery. however, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. moreover, the annual rate of change of mfi loans to the private sector remained negative in may and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors are likely to continue to dampen the pace of the economic recovery. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. in particular, geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively, including through effects on energy prices and global demand for euro area products. a further downside risk relates to insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker than expected domestic demand.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.5% in june 2014, unchanged from may. among the main components, services price inflation increased from 1.1% in may to 1.3% in june, while food price inflation fell from 0.1% to -0.2%. on the basis of current information, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. meanwhile, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  the governing council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. in this context, we will closely monitor the possible repercussions of geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments. turning to the monetary analysis, data for may 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3). annual growth in m3 was 1.0% in may, compared with 0.7% in april. the growth of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 moderated to 5.0 % in may, after 5.2% in april. the increase in the mfi net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, has recently been an important factor supporting annual m3 growth. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.5% in may 2014, compared with -2.8% in april. lending to non-financial corporations continues to be weak, reflecting the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in may 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. against the background of weak credit growth, the ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets is of key importance. banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby supporting the scope for credit expansion during the next stages of the recovery. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the current low level of inflation should be followed by a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.  as regards fiscal policies, substantial fiscal consolidation in recent years has contributed to reducing budgetary imbalances. important structural reforms have increased competitiveness and the adjustment capacity of countries’ labour and product markets. however, significant challenges remain. to strengthen the foundations for sustainable growth and sound public finances, euro area countries should not unravel the progress made with fiscal consolidation, in line with the stability and growth pact, and should proceed with structural reforms in the coming years. fiscal consolidation should be designed in a growth-friendly manner, and structural reforms should focus on fostering private investment and job creation. a full and consistent implementation of the euro area’s existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the euro area’s resilience to shocks.  finally, i wish to inform you that the governing council today announces that the frequency of our monetary policy meetings will change to a six-week cycle, from january 2015. the reserve maintenance

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140605.en.html,5 June 2014,"in pursuing our price stability mandate, today we decided on a combination of measures to provide additional monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. this package includes further reductions in the key ecb interest rates, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, preparatory work related to outright purchases of asset-backed securities and a prolongation of fixed rate, full allotment tender procedures. in addition, we have decided to suspend the weekly fine-tuning operation sterilising the liquidity injected under the securities markets programme. the decisions are based on our economic analysis, taking into account the latest macroeconomic projections by eurosystem staff, and the signals coming from the monetary analysis. together, the measures will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. looking ahead, the governing council is strongly determined to safeguard this anchoring. concerning our forward guidance, the key ecb interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation. this expectation is further underpinned by our decisions today. moreover, if required, we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing. the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. let me now briefly describe the individual measures decided today. further details will be published at 3.30 p.m. on the ecb’s website. first, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by 10 basis points to 0.15% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 35 basis points to 0.40%. the rate on the deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis points to -0.10%. these changes will come into effect on 11 june 2014. the negative rate will also apply to reserve holdings in excess of the minimum reserve requirements and certain other deposits held with the eurosystem. second, in order to support bank lending to households and non-financial corporations, excluding loans to households for house purchase, we will be conducting a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltros). all tltros will mature in september 2018, i.e. in around 4 years. counterparties will be entitled to borrow, initially, 7% of the total amount of their loans to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, outstanding on 30 april 2014. lending to the public sector will not be considered in this calculation. the combined initial entitlement amounts to some €400 billion. to that effect, two successive tltros will be conducted in september and december 2014. in addition, from march 2015 to june 2016, all counterparties will be able to borrow, quarterly, up to three times the amount of their net lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, over a specific period in excess of a specified benchmark. net lending will be measured in terms of new loans minus redemptions. loan sales, securitisations and write-downs do not affect the net lending measure. the interest rate on the tltros will be fixed over the life of each operation, at the rate on the eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (mros) prevailing at the time of take-up, plus a fixed spread of 10 basis points. starting 24 months after each tltro, counterparties will have the option to make repayments. a number of provisions will aim to ensure that the funds support the real economy. those counterparties that have not fulfilled certain conditions regarding the volume of their net lending to the real economy will be required to pay back borrowings in september 2016.  in addition, the governing council decided to extend the existing eligibility of additional assets as collateral, notably under the additional credit claims framework, at least until september 2018. third, the governing council decided to intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases in the abs market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. under this initiative, the eurosystem will consider purchasing simple and transparent asset-backed securities with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector, taking into account the desirable changes in the regulatory environment, and will work with other relevant institutions to that effect. fourth, in line with our forward guidance and our determination to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation, as well as to contain volatility in money markets, we decided to continue conducting the mros as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period ending in december 2016. furthermore, we decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted before the end of the reserve maintenance period ending in december 2016 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. in addition, we decided to suspend the weekly fine-tuning operation sterilising the liquidity injected under the securities markets programme. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of this year. this confirmed the ongoing gradual recovery, while the outcome was somewhat weaker than expected. most recent survey results signal moderate growth also in the second quarter of 2014. looking ahead, domestic demand should continue to be supported by a number of factors, including the accommodative monetary policy stance, ongoing improvements in financing conditions working their way through to the real economy, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and gains in real disposable income resulting from falls in energy prices. at the same time, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. moreover, the annual rate of change of mfi loans to the private sector remained negative in april and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors are likely to continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery.  this assessment of a moderate recovery is also reflected in the june 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.0% in 2014, 1.7% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. compared with the march 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for real gdp growth for 2014 has been revised downwards and the projection for 2015 has been revised upwards. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker export growth. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.5% in may 2014, after 0.7% in april. this outcome was lower than expected. on the basis of the information available to us at today’s meeting, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing only gradually during 2015 and 2016, thereby underpinning the case for today’s decisions. meanwhile, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. looking ahead, the governing council is strongly determined to safeguard this anchoring. our assessment has been supported by the june 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. they foresee annual hicp inflation at 0.7% in 2014, 1.1% in 2015 and 1.4% in 2016. in the last quarter of 2016, annual hicp inflation is projected to be 1.5%. in comparison with the march 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for inflation for 2014, 2015 and 2016 have been revised downwards. it should be stressed that the projections are conditional on a number of technical assumptions, including exchange rates and oil prices, and that the uncertainty surrounding each projection increases with the length of the projection horizon. the governing council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. in this context, we will closely monitor the possible repercussions of geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments. turning to the monetary analysis, data for april 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3). annual growth in m3 moderated further to 0.8% in april, from 1.0% in march. the growth of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 moderated to 5.2 % in april, after 5.6% in march. in the recent past, the increase in the mfi net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, has been the main factor supporting annual m3 growth. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.7% in april 2014, compared with -3.1% in march. weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.4% in april 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis led the governing council to decide on a combination of measures to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy.  in order to strengthen the economic recovery, banks and policy-makers in the euro area must step up their efforts. against the background of weak credit growth, the ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets is of key importance. banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby contributing to overcome any existing credit supply restriction that could hamper the recovery. at the same time, policy-makers in the euro area should push ahead in the areas of fiscal policies and structural reforms.  as regards fiscal policies, the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections indicate continued progress in restoring sound public finances in the euro area. the aggregate euro area general government deficit is projected to decline gradually from 3.0% of gdp in 2013 to 2.5% of gdp in 2014. for 2015 and 2016, a further decline to 2.3% and 1.9 %, respectively, is projected. general government debt is projected to peak at 93.4% of gdp this year. thereafter, it is projected to decline, reaching around 91% in 2016. as regards structural reforms, important steps have been taken to increase the competitiveness and the adjustment capacity of countries’ labour and product markets, although progress has been uneven and is far from complete. in this context, the governing council takes note of the european commission’s recommendations on fiscal and structural policies, published on 2 june 2014, to continue the path of reducing budgetary and macroeconomic imbalances. the recommendation to the council to abrogate the excessive deficit procedures for four euro area countries indicates continued progress in restoring sound public finances. however, euro area countries should not unravel progress made with fiscal consolidation. a full and consistent implementation of the euro area’s macroeconomic surveillance framework, together with the necessary policy actions by euro area countries, will help to raise potential growth, increase the euro area’s resilience to shocks and facilitate job creation",pursue price stability mandate today

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140508.en.html,8 May 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. incoming information continues to indicate that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. at the same time, recent information remains consistent with our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by only a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates. the signals from the monetary analysis confirm the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  looking ahead, we will monitor economic developments and money markets very closely. we will maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation and act swiftly, if required, with further monetary policy easing. we firmly reiterate that we continue to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy, the high degree of unutilised capacity, and subdued money and credit creation. the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation. further information and analysis concerning the outlook for inflation and the availability of bank loans to the private sector will be available in early june.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2013, thereby increasing for three consecutive quarters. recent data and survey indicators confirm that the ongoing moderate recovery continued in the first quarter of 2014 and at the beginning of the second quarter. looking ahead, domestic demand should continue to be supported by a number of factors, including the accommodative monetary policy stance, ongoing improvements in financing conditions working their way through to the real economy, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and developments in energy prices. at the same time, although labour markets have stabilised and shown the first signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. moreover, the annual rate of change of mfi loans to the private sector remained negative in march and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. geopolitical risks, as well as developments in global financial markets and emerging market economies, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker export growth. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.7% in april 2014, up from 0.5% in march. as expected, given the timing of easter, the increase was mainly due to a rise in services prices. on the basis of current information, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain around present low levels over the coming months, before only gradually increasing during 2015 to reach levels closer to 2% towards the end of 2016. new macroeconomic projections by eurosystem staff will become available in early june. medium to long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. the governing council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. in this context, the possible repercussions of both geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments will be monitored closely.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for march 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3). annual growth in m3 moderated to 1.1% in march, from 1.3% in february. the growth of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained robust but decreased to 5.6 % in march, after 6.2% in february. the increase in the mfi net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, remains the main factor supporting annual m3 growth. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was ‑3.1% in march, unchanged from february. weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.4% in march 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013.  the april 2014 bank lending survey confirmed the stabilisation of credit conditions for loans to enterprises and households. credit standards over the previous three months remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises but were eased in net terms for households. broadly in line with these results, in the survey on the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) for the period october 2013-march 2014, smes reported that bank loan availability had become less negative and had actually improved in some euro area countries. according to both surveys, the general economic outlook contributed less negatively or even positively to these developments. at the same time, banks still reported tight levels of credit standards when seen in a historical perspective. since the summer of 2012, substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. in this context, the ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets is of key importance. banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby contributing to overcome any existing credit supply restriction that could hamper the recovery. to sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by only a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term.  regarding fiscal policies, according to the european commission’s spring forecast, the general government deficit in the euro area is expected to decline further, from 3.0% of gdp in 2013 to 2.5% this year and to 2.3% in 2015. the government debt-to-gdp ratio is expected to stabilise at 96.0% in 2014 and to decline to 95.4% in 2015. in view of still rather high debt ratios and to improve fiscal sustainability, euro area countries should not unravel progress made with fiscal consolidation and should comply with their commitments under the stability and growth pact. at the same time, comprehensive and ambitious structural reforms in product and labour markets are warranted to lift the euro area’s growth potential, improve its adjustment capacity and reduce the high unemployment facing many euro area countries today. to this end, the governing council concurs with tuesday’s ecofin council communication that decisive policy action is needed in countries where macroeconomic imbalances hinder the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming information continue indicate

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140403.en.html,3 April 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged.

expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates. the signals from the monetary analysis confirm the picture of subdued underlying price

degree of monetary accommodation and to act swiftly if required. hence, we do not exclude further monetary policy easing and we firmly reiterate that we continue to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy, the high degree of unutilised capacity and subdued money and credit creation. at the same time, we are closely following developments on money markets. the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2013, after 0.1% and 0.3% in the previous two quarters respectively. survey data that encompass the first quarter of this year are consistent with continued moderate growth, confirming previous expectations that the ongoing recovery is increasingly supported by firmer domestic demand. looking ahead, some further improvement in domestic demand should materialise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, ongoing improvements in financing conditions working their way through to the real economy, and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. in addition, real incomes are supported by moderate price developments, in particular lower energy prices. economic activity is also expected to benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for euro area exports. at the same time, although labour markets have shown the first signs of improvement, unemployment in the euro area remains high and, overall, unutilised capacity is sizeable. moreover, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. developments in global financial markets and in emerging market economies, as well as geopolitical risks, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker export growth. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.5% in march 2014, down from 0.7% in february. the decrease reflects falls in the annual rates of change of the food, goods and services components, partly offset by a more moderate decline in energy prices. on the basis of current exchange rates and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual hicp inflation is expected to pick up somewhat in april, partly related to the volatility of service prices in the months around easter. over the following months, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain low, before gradually increasing during 2015 to reach levels closer to 2% towards the end of 2016. at the same time, medium to long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. the governing council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. in this context, the possible repercussions of both geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments will be monitored closely.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for february 2014 point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3). annual growth in m3 was broadly stable in february at 1.3%, compared with 1.2% in january. the growth of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained robust at 6.2% in february, after 6.1% in january. the main factor supporting annual m3 growth continued to be the increase in the mfi net external asset position, reflecting the keen interest of international investors in euro area assets.  mfi loans to the private sector continued to decline in february. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -3.1%, compared with -2.8% in january. weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.4% in february 2014, still broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. since the summer of 2012, substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. this is the objective of the ongoing comprehensive assessment by the ecb.  to sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term.  as regards fiscal policies, euro area countries have made important progress in correcting fiscal imbalances. they should not unravel past consolidation achievements and should put high government debt ratios on a downward trajectory over the medium term, in line with the stability and growth pact. fiscal strategies should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation to achieve better quality and more efficient public services, while minimising the distortionary effects of taxation. further decisive steps are needed to reform product and labour markets with a view to improving competitiveness, raising potential growth, generating employment

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140306.en.html,6 March 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. at the same time, the latest ecb staff macroeconomic projections, now covering the period up to the end of 2016, support earlier expectations of a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement in hicp inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. in keeping with this picture, monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  regarding the medium-term outlook for prices and growth, the information and analysis now available fully confirm our decision to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance for as long as necessary. this will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. we firmly reiterate our forward guidance. we continue to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy, the high degree of unutilised capacity and subdued money and credit creation. we are monitoring developments on money markets closely and are ready to consider all instruments available to us. overall, we remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2013, thereby increasing for three consecutive quarters. developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to february are consistent with continued moderate growth also in the first quarter of this year. looking ahead, the ongoing recovery is expected to proceed, albeit at a slow pace. in particular, some further improvement in domestic demand should materialise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, improving financing conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reform. in addition, real incomes are supported by lower energy prices. economic activity is also expected to benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for euro area exports. at the same time, although unemployment in the euro area is stabilising, it remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1.2% in 2014, 1.5% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. compared with the december 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for real gdp growth for 2014 has been revised slightly upwards.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. developments in global financial markets and in emerging market economies, as well as geopolitical risks, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.8% in february 2014, unchanged from the (upwardly revised) outcome for january. while energy prices fell more strongly in february than in the previous month, increases in industrial goods and services prices were higher than in january. on the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual hicp inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. thereafter, inflation rates should gradually increase and reach levels closer to 2%, in line with inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term.  this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.0% in 2014, 1.3% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. in the last quarter of 2016, annual hicp inflation is projected to be 1.7%. in comparison with the december 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2014 has been revised slightly downwards. in view of the first publication of a three-year projection horizon in the march 2014 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, it should be stressed that the projections are conditional on a number of technical assumptions, including unchanged exchange rates and declining oil prices, and that the uncertainty surrounding the projections increases with the length of the projection horizon.  regarding the governing council’s risk assessment, both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as limited and are considered to be broadly balanced over the medium term.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for january 2014 confirm the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3) and credit. annual growth in m3 increased to 1.2% in january, from 1.0% in december. the monthly inflow to m3 in january was substantial, compensating for the strong outflow in december. the increase in m3 growth reflected a stronger annual growth rate of m1, which rose to 6.2% from 5.7% in december. as in previous months, the main factor supporting annual m3 growth was an increase in the mfi net external asset position, which continued to reflect the increased interest of international investors in euro area assets. the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector continued to contract. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in january, unchanged from december. weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.2% in january 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. this is the objective of the ongoing comprehensive assessment by the ecb, while a timely implementation of additional steps to establish a banking union will further help to restore confidence in the financial system. to sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards levels of inflation closer to 2%. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term.  as regards fiscal policies, the ecb staff macroeconomic projections indicate continued progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in the euro area. the aggregate euro area general government deficit is expected to have declined to 3.2% of gdp in 2013 and is projected to be reduced further to 2.7% of gdp this year. general government debt is projected to peak at 93.5% of gdp in 2014, before declining slightly in 2015. looking ahead, euro area countries should not unravel past consolidation efforts and should put high government debt ratios on a downward trajectory over the medium term. fiscal strategies should be in line with the stability and growth pact and should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation which combines improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. national authorities should also continue with the decisive implementation of structural reforms in all euro area countries. these reforms should aim, in particular, to make it easier to do business and to boost employment, thus enhancing the euro area’s growth potential and reducing unemployment in the euro area countries. to this end, the governing council welcomes the european commission’s communication of yesterday on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and on the excessive deficit procedure. looking ahead, it is key that the macroeconomic surveillance framework in the euro area, which was significantly strengthened in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, is implemented fully and in a consistent manner",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming information confirm moderate recovery economy proceed line previous assessment time late staff

incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. at the same time, underlying price pressures in the euro area remain weak and monetary and credit dynamics are subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining

below, but close to, 2% later on. regarding the medium-term outlook for prices and growth, further information and analysis will become available in early march. recent evidence fully confirms our decision to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary, which will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. we firmly reiterate our forward guidance. we continue to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. with regard to recent money market volatility and its potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments. overall, we remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following two quarters of positive real gdp growth, developments in recent data and surveys overall suggest that the moderate recovery continued in the last quarter of 2013. looking ahead, our previous assessment of economic growth has been confirmed. output in the euro area is expected to recover at a slow pace. in particular, some improvement in domestic demand should materialise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, improving financing conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. in addition, real incomes are supported by lower energy price inflation. economic activity is also expected to benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for euro area exports. at the same time, although unemployment in the euro area is stabilising, it remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and the private sector will continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties, notably in emerging market economies, may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.7% in january 2014, after 0.8% in december. this decline was mainly due to energy price developments. at the same time, the inflation rate in january 2014 was lower than generally expected on the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual hicp inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. over the medium term, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments remain limited, and they continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for december 2013 confirm the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3) and credit. annual growth in m3 moderated to 1.0% in december, from 1.5% in november. deposit outflows in december mirrored the strong sales of government and private sector securities by euro area mfis, which, in part, could be related to adjustments by banks in anticipation of the ecb’s comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets. these developments also affected annual growth in m1, which moderated to 5.8% in december but remained strong. as in previous months, the main factor supporting annual m3 growth was an increase in the mfi net external asset position, which continued to reflect the increased interest of international investors in euro area assets. the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector continued to contract. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in december, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in december, after -3.1% in november. the january 2014 bank lending survey provides indications of some further stabilisation in credit conditions for firms and households and a smaller net decline in loan demand by enterprises. overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140109.en.html,9 January 2014,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. incoming information and analysis have continued to confirm our previous assessment. underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. in keeping with this picture, monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term are firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. such a constellation continues to suggest that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. against this background, the governing council strongly emphasises that it will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary, which will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. accordingly, we firmly reiterate our forward guidance that we continue to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. as previously stated, this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. with regard to money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments. overall, we remain determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2013, following an increase of 0.3% in the second quarter. while developments in industrial production data for october point to a weak start to the fourth quarter, survey-based confidence indicators up to december have improved further from low levels, overall indicating a continuation of the gradual recovery in economic activity. looking at 2014 and 2015, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to some improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since the summer of 2012 appear to be working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. in addition, real incomes have benefited recently from lower energy price inflation. at the same time, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and the private sector will continue to weigh on economic activity. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.8% in december 2013, compared with 0.9% in november. this outcome was broadly as expected and reflected lower services price inflation. on the basis of prevailing futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. over the medium term, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  the risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to higher commodity prices and stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, data for november support the assessment of continued subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3) and credit. annual growth in m3 was broadly unchanged at 1.5% in november, after 1.4% in october, following two consecutive declines in september and august. annual growth in m1 remained strong at 6.5%, reflecting a preference for liquidity, although it was below the peak of 8.7% observed in april 2013. as in previous months, the main factor supporting annual m3 growth was an increase in the mfi net external asset position, which continued to reflect the increased interest of international investors in euro area assets. the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in november, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -3.1% in november, following -3.0% in october. overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. the forthcoming comprehensive assessment by the ecb will further support this confidence-building process. it will enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary corrective actions. a timely implementation of further steps to establish a banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.  as regards fiscal policies, it is important not to unravel past efforts but to sustain fiscal consolidation over the medium term. fiscal strategies should be in line with the fiscal compact and should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation which combines improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. when accompanied by the decisive implementation of structural reforms, this will further support the gradual economic recovery in the euro area and have a positive impact on public finances. reforms in product and labour markets and a rigorous enactment of single market policies warrant particular focus to improve the outlook for economic growth and to foster job creation in an environment of high unemployment",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming information analysis continue

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2013/html/is131205.en.html,5 December 2013,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. incoming information and analysis have confirmed our assessment and monetary policy decisions of last month. underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. in keeping with this picture, monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, and will thereby continue to assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. in this context, the governing council confirmed its forward guidance that it continues to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation continues to be based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. with regard to money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following a rise of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013, real gdp in the euro area increased by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter. developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to november are consistent with a positive growth rate also in the fourth quarter of the year. looking ahead to 2014 and 2015, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to some improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last year appear to be working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. in addition, real incomes have benefited recently from lower energy price inflation. at the same time, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and the private sector will continue to weigh on economic activity. this assessment is also reflected in the december 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp declining by 0.4% in 2013 before increasing by 1.1% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015. compared with the september 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for real gdp growth for 2013 has remained unchanged and it has been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point for 2014. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area are assessed to be on the downside. developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation increased in november 2013 to 0.9%, from 0.7% in october. the increase was broadly as expected and reflected, in particular, an upward base effect in energy prices and higher services price inflation. on the basis of prevailing futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. over the medium term, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.  broadly in line with this assessment, the december 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.4% in 2013, at 1.1% in 2014 and at 1.3% in 2015. in comparison with the september 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised downwards by 0.1 percentage point and for 2014 it has been revised downwards by 0.2 percentage point. the risks to the outlook for price developments are seen to be broadly balanced over the medium term. upside risks relate to higher commodity prices and stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, while downside risks stem from weaker than expected economic activity. concerning the staff macroeconomic projections, let me inform you that the governing council has decided to publish more details as of december 2013. you will receive this material today after the press conference.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for october confirm the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (m3) and credit. annual growth in m3 moderated to 1.4% in october, from 2.0% in september. this moderation was partly related to a base effect. annual growth in m1 remained strong at 6.6%, reflecting a preference for liquidity, although it was below the peak of 8.7% observed in april. net capital inflows into the euro area continued to be the main factor supporting annual m3 growth, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in october, broadly unchanged since the beginning of the year. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in october, following -2.8% in september and -2.9% in august. overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. the ecb’s comprehensive assessment before it adopts its supervisory role under the single supervisory mechanism will further support this confidence-building process. it will enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary corrective actions. further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.  as regards fiscal policies, the governing council welcomes the european commission’s assessment of the 2014 draft budgetary plans which were submitted in october for the first time under the “two-pack” regulations. this new surveillance exercise needs to be fully effective. in order to put high public debt ratios on a downward path, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and sustain fiscal adjustment over the medium term. in particular, consolidation measures should be growth-friendly and have a medium-term perspective, so as both to improve public services and minimise the distortionary effects of taxation. at the same time, there is a need to push ahead with product and labour market reforms, in order to improve competitiveness, raise potential growth, generate employment opportunities and foster the adaptability of our economies",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming information

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2013/html/is131107.en.html,7 November 2013,"first, based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 25 basis points to 0.75%. the rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%. these decisions are in line with our forward guidance of july 2013, given the latest indications of further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term, starting from currently low annual inflation rates of below 1%. in keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. accordingly, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. it will thereby also continue to assist the gradual economic recovery as reflected in confidence indicators up to october. second, following today’s rate cut, the governing council reviewed the forward guidance provided in july and confirmed that it continues to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation continues to be based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics.  third, we continue to monitor closely money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance. we are ready to consider all available instruments and, in this context, we decided today to continue conducting the main refinancing operations (mros) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the 6th maintenance period of 2015 on 7 july 2015. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2015. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. furthermore, we decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted until the end of the second quarter of 2015 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2013, following six quarters of falling output. developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to october are consistent with continued, albeit modest, growth in the second half of the year. looking ahead, output is expected to continue to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last year appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. in addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower energy price inflation. this being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased in october 2013 to 0.7%, from 1.1% in september. this decline was stronger than expected and reflected, in particular, lower food price inflation, a larger fall in energy prices and some weakening in services price inflation. on the basis of current futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at low levels in the coming months. underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. at the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below but close to 2% later on.  taking into account today’s decisions, the risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced over the medium term. upside risks relate in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stem from weaker than expected economic activity.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for september confirm the subdued underlying growth of broad money (m3) and, in particular, credit. annual growth in m3 moderated to 2.1% in september, from 2.3% in august. annual growth in m1 remained strong at 6.6%, reflecting a preference for liquidity, although it was below the peak of 8.7% observed in april. net capital inflows into the euro area continued to be the main factor supporting annual m3 growth, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in september, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.7% in september, compared with -2.9% in august. overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect primarily their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. at the same time, the october 2013 bank lending survey tentatively signals a stabilisation in credit conditions for firms and households, in the context of still weak loan demand.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. the ecb’s comprehensive assessment before it adopts its supervisory role under the single supervisory mechanism will further support this confidence-building process. it will enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary corrective actions. further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system.  to sum up, taking into account today’s decisions, the economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.  as regards fiscal policies, the euro area budget deficit is projected to decline further from 3.1% of gdp in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014, according to the european commission’s autumn 2013 economic forecast. at the same time, the euro area government debt ratio is expected to rise from 95.5% of gdp in 2013 to 95.9% in 2014. in order to put high public debt ratios on a downward path, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and sustain fiscal adjustment over the medium term. the composition of fiscal consolidation should be geared towards growth-friendly measures which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. governments must also decisively strengthen efforts to implement the needed structural reforms in product and labour markets. progress has been made in reducing current account deficits and unit labour cost differentials, but substantial efforts still need to be undertaken with a view to further improving competitiveness, supporting rebalancing within the euro area and creating more flexible and dynamic economies that in turn generate sustainable economic growth and employment",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide lower

incoming information and analysis have further underpinned our previous assessment. underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. in keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at the same time, real gdp growth in the second quarter was positive, after six quarters of negative output growth, and confidence indicators up to september confirm the expected gradual improvement in economic activity from low levels. our monetary policy stance continues to be geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions. it thereby provides support to a gradual recovery in economic activity. looking ahead, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, in line with the forward guidance provided in july. the governing council confirms that it expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. this expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. in the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. with regard to money market conditions, we will remain particularly attentive to developments which may have implications for the stance of monetary policy and are ready to consider all available instruments.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real gdp rose, quarter on quarter, by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013, also supported by temporary factors related to unusually adverse weather conditions in some euro area countries earlier this year. developments in industrial production data point to somewhat weaker growth at the beginning of the third quarter, while survey-based confidence indicators up to september have improved further from low levels, overall confirming our previous expectations of a gradual recovery in economic activity. looking ahead, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of external demand for exports. furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. in addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower inflation. this being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include higher commodity prices in the context of renewed geopolitical tensions, weaker than expected global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, and broadly in line with expectations, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased in september 2013 to 1.1%, from 1.3% in august. on the basis of current futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at such low levels in the coming months. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability.  the risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity.  turning to the monetary analysis, data for august indicate that the underlying growth of broad money (m3) and, in particular, credit remained subdued. annual growth in m3 continued to be broadly stable at 2.3% in august, compared with 2.2% in july. annual growth in m1 remained strong but decreased to 6.8% in august, from 7.1% in july. net capital inflows into the euro area continued to be the main factor supporting annual m3 growth, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.4% in august, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in august, compared with -2.8% in july. weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect primarily their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to accomplish this objective.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.  as regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and put high government debt ratios on a downward path. the draft budgetary plans that countries will now deliver for the first time under the “two-pack” regulations need to provide for sufficiently far-reaching measures to achieve the fiscal targets for 2014. governments must also decisively strengthen efforts to implement the needed structural reforms in product and labour markets. these reforms are required not only to help countries to regain competitiveness and to rebalance within the euro area, but also to create more flexible and dynamic economies that generate sustainable economic growth and employment",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming

incoming information and analysis have further underpinned our previous assessment. underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. in keeping with

in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. in the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. with regard to money market conditions, these have also been influenced by a gradual reduction in excess liquidity. repayments of funds taken up in the context of the three-year longer-term refinancing operations reflect improvements in financial market confidence, some reduction in financial market fragmentation and the ongoing deleveraging by euro area banks. we will remain particularly attentive to the implications that these developments may have for the stance of monetary policy.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real gdp rose, quarter on quarter, by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013. this increase is partly explained by transitory effects related to weather conditions in the first half of this year. since then, survey-based confidence indicators up to august have improved further from low levels, overall confirming our previous expectations of a gradual recovery in economic activity. looking ahead to the remainder of the year and to 2014, in line with our baseline scenario, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of external demand for exports. furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. in addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower inflation. this being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity.  this assessment is also reflected in the september 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp declining by 0.4% in 2013 and increasing by 1.0% in 2014. compared with the june 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for 2013 has been revised upwards by 0.2 percentage point, largely reflecting incoming data. for 2014 there has been a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. recent developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include higher commodity prices in the context of renewed geopolitical tensions, weaker than expected global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, as expected, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.3% in august 2013, down from 1.6% in june and july. on the basis of current assumptions for energy and exchange rate developments, annual inflation rates are expected to remain low in the coming months, owing in particular to energy price developments. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability.  this assessment is also reflected in the september 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.5% in 2013 and 1.3% in 2014. in comparison with the june 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point, while the projection for 2014 remains unchanged. the risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, data for july confirm that underlying broad money (m3) and, in particular, credit growth remained subdued. annual growth in m3 decreased further in july to 2.2%, from 2.4% in june. annual growth in m1 remained strong but decreased to 7.1% in july, from 7.5% in june. m3 growth continued to be mainly supported by net capital inflows into the euro area, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector weakened further. the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in july, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.8% in july, compared with -2.3% in june. weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.  in order to further reduce imbalances and to foster competitiveness, growth and job creation, euro area countries need to continue with their reform agenda. as regards fiscal policies, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and put debt ratios on a downward path. the composition of fiscal consolidation should be geared towards growth-friendly measures which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. in terms of economic policies, product market reforms to increase competitiveness will facilitate the creation of new businesses, support the tradable goods sector and foster job creation, while high unemployment rates require decisive structural reforms to reduce rigidities in labour markets and to increase labour demand",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming

starting with the economic analysis. following a six-quarter economic contraction in the euro area, recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels and tentatively confirm the expectation of a stabilisation in economic activity at low levels. at the same time, labour market conditions remain weak. looking ahead to the remainder of the year and to 2014, euro area export growth should benefit from a gradual recovery in global demand, while domestic demand should be supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance as well as the recent gains in real income owing to generally lower inflation. furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. this being said, the remaining necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover at a slow pace.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. recent developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.6% in july 2013, unchanged from june. annual inflation rates are currently expected to temporarily fall over the coming months, owing particularly to base effects relating to energy price developments twelve months earlier. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability.  the risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, underlying money and, in particular, credit growth remained subdued in june. annual growth in broad money (m3) decreased in june to 2.3%, from 2.9% in may. moreover, annual growth in m1 decreased to 7.5% in june, from 8.4% in may. the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector weakened further. while the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in june, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year, the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.3% in june, after -2.1% in may. weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2013 confirms that borrowers’ risk and macroeconomic uncertainty remained the main factors restraining banks’ lending policies. at the same time, the degree of net tightening of credit standards for loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged in the second quarter of 2013, compared with the first quarter, and declined for loans to households.  since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. in order to ensure an

bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits. the emphasis should be on growth-friendly fiscal strategies which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. to reinforce the overall impact of such a strategy, member states must step up the implementation of the necessary structural reforms so as to foster competitiveness, growth and job creation. removing rigidities in the labour market, lowering the administrative burden and strengthening competition in product markets will particularly support small and medium-sized enterprises. these structural reform measures are essential to bring down the currently high level of unemployment, in particular among the younger citizens of the euro area",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged incoming information

the same time, labour market conditions remain weak. recent developments in cyclical indicators, particularly those based on survey data, indicate some further improvement from low levels. looking

potential to negatively affect economic conditions. other downside risks include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  as stated in previous months, annual inflation rates are expected to be subject to some volatility throughout the year owing particularly to base effects. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.6% in june 2013, up from 1.4% in may. this increase reflected an upward base effect relating to energy price developments twelve months earlier. however, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued over the medium term, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability.  the risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the subdued monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics. annual growth in broad money (m3) decreased in may to 2.9%, from 3.2% in april. moreover, annual growth in m1 decreased to 8.4% in may, from 8.7% in april. the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained negative. while the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in may, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year, the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) weakened further to -2.1% in may, from -1.9% in april. as in april, strong monthly net redemptions in may were concentrated in short-term loans, possibly reflecting reduced demand for working capital against the background of weak order books in early spring. more generally, weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. this has contributed to reducing reliance on eurosystem funding, as reflected in the ongoing repayments of the three-year longer-term refinancing operations (ltros). in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets continues to decline further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. in particular, the future single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. with regard to other economic policies, the governing council notes the initiatives taken by the european council of 27-28 june 2013 in the areas of youth unemployment, investment and financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the european council’s endorsement of the country-specific recommendations of the 2013 european semester. the governing council stresses that implementation of these recommendations is essential to contribute to a sustainable recovery in the euro area. moreover, the new european governance framework for fiscal and economic policies should be applied in a steadfast manner and much more determined efforts should be pursued to carry forward structural reforms to foster growth and employment. in this respect, the governing council deems it particularly important to target competitiveness and adjustment capacities in labour and product markets. finally, the governing council welcomes the setting-out of a number of steps towards the completion of the banking union as moves in the right direction, but also urges that they be

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2013/html/is130606.en.html,6 June 2013,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. incoming information has confirmed our assessment which led to the cut in interest rates in early may. the underlying price pressure in the euro area is expected to remain subdued over the medium term. in keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. medium-term inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. at the same time, recent economic sentiment survey data have shown some improvement from low levels. the accommodative stance of our monetary policy, together with the significant improvements in financial markets since mid-2012, should contribute to support prospects for an economic recovery later in the year. against this overall background, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. in the period ahead, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2013, following a decline of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012. output has thus declined for six consecutive quarters, with labour market conditions remaining weak. recent developments in economic sentiment survey data have shown some improvement from low levels. looking ahead to later in the year and to 2014, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand, while domestic demand should be supported by the accommodative stance of our monetary policy and by the recent real income gains due to lower oil prices and generally lower inflation. furthermore, the significant improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. at the same time, the remaining necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover in the course of the year, albeit at a subdued pace.  this assessment is also reflected in the june 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp declining by 0.6% in 2013 and increasing by 1.1% in 2014. compared with the march 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for 2013 has been revised marginally downwards, largely reflecting the incorporation of the latest gdp data releases. for 2014 there has been a marginal upward revision. the governing council continues to see downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area. they include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.4% in may 2013, up from 1.2% in april. this increase was, in particular, accounted for by a rebound in services prices related to the unwinding of the easter effect and an increase in food prices. more generally, as stated last month, annual inflation rates are expected to be subject to some volatility throughout the year due particularly to base effects relating to energy and food price developments twelve months earlier. looking through this volatility, the underlying price pressure over the medium term is expected to remain subdued, reflecting low capacity utilisation and a modest pace of economic recovery. over the medium term, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability.  this assessment is also reflected in the june 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.4 % and 1.3 % in 2013 and 2014, respectively. in comparison with the march 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised downwards, mainly reflecting the fall in oil prices, while the projection for 2014 remains unchanged. in the governing council’s assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm that the underlying pace of monetary and, in particular, credit expansion continues to be subdued. annual growth in broad money, m3, increased in april to 3.2%, from 2.6% in march, mainly due to a base effect and special factors. the same factors have impacted on the annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate, m1, which increased from 7.1% in march to 8.7% in april.  the growth of loans to the private sector continued to be weak. the annual growth rates of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in april, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. the annual negative growth of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased from -1.3% in march to -1.9% in april. this development stemmed, in particular, from net redemptions in short-term loans, which could reflect reduced demand for working capital against the background of weak order books in early spring. more generally, weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  in order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets continues to decline further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. progress has been made since last summer in improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing reliance on the eurosystem as reflected in repayments of the three-year ltros. further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. in particular, the governing council emphasises that the future single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. with regard to fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, the governing council welcomes the progress made and encourages governments to continue with determined efforts. it is essential that euro area countries do not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits. the new european governance framework for fiscal and economic policies should be applied in a steadfast manner. in this respect, the governing council considers it very important that decisions by the eu council to extend the time frame for the correction of excessive fiscal deficits should remain reserved for exceptional circumstances. at the same time, it is necessary to continue, where needed, to take legislative action or otherwise promptly implement structural reforms. structural reforms should, in particular, target competitiveness and adjustment capacities in labour and product markets, thereby helping to generate employment opportunities in an environment of unacceptably high unemployment levels, especially among young workers, prevailing in several countries. combined action on the fiscal and structural front should mutually reinforce fiscal sustainability and economic growth potential and thereby foster sustainable job creation",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2013/html/is130502.en.html,2 May 2013,"first, based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by 25 basis points to 0.50% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 50 basis points to 1.00%. the rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%. these decisions are consistent with low underlying price pressure over the medium term. inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. in keeping with this picture, monetary and loan dynamics remain subdued. at the same time, weak economic sentiment has extended into spring of this year. the cut in interest rates should contribute to support prospects for a recovery later in the year. against this overall background, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as needed. in the period ahead, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. second, we are closely monitoring money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance and its transmission to the economy. in this context, we decided today to continue conducting the main refinancing operations (mros) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the 6th maintenance period of 2014 on 8 july 2014. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2014. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. furthermore, we decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted until the end of the second quarter of 2014 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro.  third, the governing council decided to start consultations with other european institutions on initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities collateralised by loans to non-financial corporations.  in the meantime, it is essential for governments to intensify the implementation of structural reforms at national level, building on progress made in fiscal consolidation and proceeding with bank recapitalisation where needed. furthermore, they should maintain the momentum towards a genuine economic and monetary union, including the swift implementation of the banking union. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp contracted by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012, following a decline of 0.1% in the third quarter. output has thus declined for five consecutive quarters. overall, labour market conditions remain weak. recent developments in short-term indicators, notably survey data, indicate that weak economic sentiment has extended into spring of this year. looking ahead, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand and our monetary policy stance should contribute to support domestic demand. furthermore, the improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy. at the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover gradually in the second half of the year.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. they include the possibility of even weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area. these factors have the potential to dampen confidence and thereby delay the recovery. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.2% in april 2013, down from 1.7% in march. this decline in the annual inflation rate reflects a significant fall in energy prices, but is also due to a sizeable transitory effect coming from the annual rate of change in services prices on account of the timing of easter. inflation rates could remain subject to some volatility throughout the year. looking further ahead, underlying price trends should persist and, over the medium term, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability.  taking into account today’s decisions, risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. annual growth in broad money moderated in march, standing at 2.6%, after 3.1% in february. the annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate, m1, increased slightly further to 7.1% in march, reflecting the continued preference for the most liquid instruments in m3. deposits with the domestic money-holding sector continued to grow further in most stressed countries in march. the annual growth rates of loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) to non-financial corporations and households have now remained broadly unchanged since the turn of the year, standing in march at -1.3% and 0.4% respectively. to a large extent, weak loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. the recent bank lending survey (bls) confirmed weak demand for loans in the euro area. while some signs of stabilisation are emerging, the survey on the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in the euro area indicates continued tight credit conditions, particularly for smes in several euro area countries. moreover, the available information indicates high risk perception on the part of banks.  in order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets continues to decline further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. progress has been made since last summer in improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing reliance on the eurosystem as reflected in repayments of the three-year ltros. further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. in particular, the governing council emphasises that the future single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation. to sum up, taking into account today’s decisions, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. with regard to fiscal policies, the spring 2013 deficit and debt data notifications by euro area countries indicate that the average government deficit declined from 4.2% of gdp in 2011 to 3.7% in 2012. over the same period, the average government debt rose from 87.3% to 90.6% of gdp. in order to bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits and continue, where needed, to take legislative action or otherwise promptly implement structural reforms, in such a way as to mutually reinforce fiscal sustainability and economic growth potential. such structural reforms should target improvements in competitiveness and adjustment capacities, as well as aim to increase sustainable growth and employment",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide lower interest_rate main

inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and price developments over the medium term should remain contained. monetary and loan dynamics remain subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at the same time, weak economic activity has extended into the early part of the year and a gradual recovery is projected for the second half of this year, subject to downside risks. against this overall background our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as needed. in the coming weeks, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. it is essential for governments to intensify the implementation of structural reforms at national level and to strengthen euro area governance, including the implementation of the banking union. they should also build on progress made in fiscal consolidation and proceed with financial sector restructuring. we are also closely monitoring money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance and its transmission to the economy. as said on previous occasions, we will continue with fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the outcome for real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2012 was weak, with eurostat’s second estimate indicating a contraction of 0.6% quarter on quarter. the decline was largely due to a fall in domestic demand but also reflected a drop in exports. recent data and indicators confirm that the economic weakness extended into the early part of the year. looking forward, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand and our monetary policy stance should contribute to support domestic demand. furthermore, the improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy, notwithstanding recent uncertainties. together, this should help stabilise euro area economic activity and lead to a gradual recovery in the second part of the year. at the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors, and the associated tight credit conditions, will continue to weigh on economic activity. this economic outlook for the euro area remains subject to downside risks. the risks include the possibility of even weaker than expected domestic demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area. these factors have the potential to dampen the improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.7% in march 2013, down from 1.8% in february. the ongoing decline in annual inflation rates mainly reflects the energy component of the price index. looking ahead, price developments over the medium term should remain contained in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area. inflation expectations are firmly anchored and in line with price stability over the medium to long term.  risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 moderated to 3.1% in february, down from 3.5% in january. the annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate, m1, increased to 7.0% in february, from 6.6% in january. at the same time, mfi deposits in a number of stressed countries strengthened further in february. the annual growth rate of loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) to non-financial corporations and households remained broadly unchanged in february, at -1.4% and 0.4% respectively. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. at the same time, available information on non-financial corporates’ access to financing indicates tight credit conditions, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises in several euro area countries.  in order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets is reduced further and the resilience of banks strengthened where needed. however, considerable progress has been made since last summer in improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing reliance on the eurosystem as reflected in repayments of the three-year ltros. further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will

developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. as regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should build on their efforts to reduce government budget deficits and continue to implement structural reforms, thereby mutually reinforcing fiscal sustainability and economic growth. fiscal policy strategies need to be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms. such reforms should be ambitious and broad-ranging, encompassing product markets, including network industries, labour markets and the modernisation of public administration. to support employment, wage-setting should become more flexible and better aligned with productivity. these reforms will help countries in their efforts to regain competitiveness, set the foundations for sustainable growth and support the return of macroeconomic confidence",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2013/html/is130307.en.html,7 March 2013,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. hicp inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and fell below 2% in february. over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. overall, this will allow our monetary policy stance to remain accommodative. available data continue to signal that economic weakness in the euro area has extended into the beginning of the year, while broadly confirming signs of stabilisation in a number of indicators, albeit at low levels. at the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, supported by a strengthening of global demand and our accommodative monetary policy stance. in order to support confidence, it is essential for governments to continue implementing structural reforms, to build further on the progress made in fiscal consolidation, and to proceed with financial sector restructuring.  with regard to the liquidity situation of banks, counterparties have so far repaid €224.8 billion of the €1,018.7 billion obtained in the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) settled in december 2011 and march 2012. in net terms, this implies that, of the increase in the outstanding volume of bank refinancing through the ecb’s monetary policy operations of around €500 billion between mid-december 2011 and early march 2012, about €200 billion have now been repaid. these repayments reflect improvements in financial market confidence over the last few months and receding financial market fragmentation. we are closely monitoring conditions in the money market and their potential impact on the stance of monetary policy and the functioning of the transmission of our monetary policy to the economy. our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative with the full allotment mode of liquidity provision.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the gdp outcome for the fourth quarter of 2012 was weak, with eurostat’s second estimate indicating a contraction of 0.6% quarter on quarter. the decline was largely due to a fall in domestic demand but also reflected weak exports. as regards 2013, recent data and indicators suggest that economic activity should start stabilising in the first part of the year. a gradual recovery should commence in the second part, with export growth benefiting from a strengthening of global demand and domestic demand being supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance. furthermore, the improvements in financial markets since july last year and the continued implementation of structural reforms should work their way through to the economy. at the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors, and the associated tight credit conditions, will continue to weigh on economic activity. this assessment is also reflected in the march 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between -0.9% and -0.1% in 2013 and between 0.0% and 2.0% in 2014. compared with the december 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been revised slightly downwards. the revision for 2013 mainly reflects a more negative carry-over effect from the outcome for real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2012, while the projected path of the recovery has remained broadly unchanged. the governing council continues to see downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area. the risks relate to the possibility of weaker than expected domestic demand and exports and to slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area. these factors have the potential to dampen the improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.8% in february 2013, down from 2.0% in january. the on-going decline in annual inflation rates mainly reflects the energy and food components of the price index. looking ahead, while the monthly pattern of headline inflation rates may be somewhat volatile, underlying price pressures should remain contained given the environment of weak economic activity in the euro area. inflation expectations are well-anchored and in line with price stability over the medium term.  the march 2013 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 1.2% and 2.0% in 2013 and between 0.6% and 2.0% in 2014. in comparison with the december 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges are broadly unchanged.  in the governing council‘s assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. turning to the monetary analysis, monetary figures for january 2013 support our assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 remained broadly unchanged at 3.5% in january, after 3.4% in december 2012. the annual rate of growth of the narrow monetary aggregate, m1, increased to 6.7% from 6.3% in december 2012. the deposit base of mfis in a number of stressed countries strengthened further in january.  the annual growth rate of loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) to non-financial corporations stood at -1.5% in january, after -1.3% in december 2012. the annual growth in mfi loans to households moderated slightly to 0.5%, from 0.7% in december. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. at the same time, available information on the access to financing of non-financial corporates indicates tight credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.  in order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue reducing fragmentation of euro area credit markets and strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. the future single supervisory mechanism (ssm) is one of the main building blocks, together with a single resolution mechanism (srm). both are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. while the accommodative monetary policy stance will continue to support the recovery in the euro area, it is essential that fiscal and structural policies strengthen the prospects for economic growth over the medium term. as regards fiscal policies, the european commission’s 2013 winter forecast reflects progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in the euro area. the euro area-wide general government deficit is expected to have declined from 4.2% of gdp in 2011 to 3.5% of gdp in 2012 and is projected to be reduced further to 2.8% of gdp this year. governments should build on this progress with a view to further restoring confidence in the sustainability of public finances. at the same time, fiscal consolidation must be part of a comprehensive structural reform agenda to improve the outlook for job creation, economic growth and debt sustainability. in the view of the governing council, it is of particular importance at this juncture to address the current high long-term and youth unemployment. to this end, further product and labour market reforms are needed to create new job opportunities by supporting a dynamic, flexible and competitive economic environment",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged hicp_inflation rate decline far anticipate fall policy relevant horizon inflationary pressure remain

particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, as well as a strengthening of global demand. in order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring.  with regard to the liquidity situation of banks, counterparties have so far repaid €140.6 billion of the €489.2 billion obtained in the first of the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) settled in december 2011 and march 2012. this reflects the improvement in financial market confidence. repayments are provided for in the modalities of the three-year ltros and are at the discretion of the counterparties, who must appropriately assess their funding situation, their ability to provide new loans to the economy and their resilience to shocks. we will closely monitor conditions in the money market and their potential impact on the stance of monetary policy, which will remain accommodative with the full allotment mode of liquidity provision. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp declined by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2012, following a contraction of 0.2% in the second quarter. available data continue to signal further weakness in activity in the fourth quarter and at the beginning of 2013. this weakness reflects the adverse impact of low consumer and investor sentiment on domestic expenditure, as well as subdued foreign demand. however, financial market sentiment has improved and the latest survey indicators confirm earlier evidence of a stabilisation in business and consumer confidence, albeit at low levels. later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start, with domestic demand being supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, and export growth benefiting from a strengthening of global demand.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. they relate to the possibility of weaker than expected domestic demand and exports, slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, as well as geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries which could both have an impact on developments in global commodities and financial markets. these factors have the potential to dampen the ongoing improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.0% in january 2013, down from 2.2% in november and december and from 2.5% in october. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% in the coming months. over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain contained.  risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and, more recently, the appreciation of the euro exchange rate.  turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 3.3% in december 2012, from 3.8% in november. shifts from overnight deposits to short-term time deposits led to a decrease in the annual rate of growth of m1, which declined to 6.2% in december, from 6.7% in november, and outflows from marketable instruments dampened overall m3 growth. a further strengthening in the deposit base of mfis in a number of stressed countries took place in december, in combination with further capital inflows into the euro area, both of which continued to reduce fragmentation.  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative in december. this mainly reflected ongoing negative annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which was -1.3% in december after -1.5% in november. however, annual growth in mfi loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 0.7% in december. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of the financial and non-financial sectors. in line with these developments, the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2012 confirms the weakness in credit demand and the continued effect of credit risk considerations on the tightening of credit standards. at the same time, the survey confirms the positive impact of eurosystem measures on banks’ overall funding and liquidity situation. in particular, banks reported improvements across all funding categories in the fourth quarter.  in order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. the future single supervisory mechanism (ssm) is one of the main building blocks. it is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. as regards other policy areas, structural reforms and fiscal adjustment can complement each other, thereby improving the outlook for job creation, economic growth and debt sustainability. past policy action is bearing fruit, in terms of both the unwinding of existing fiscal imbalances and the reduction of current account deficits. in particular, in several countries with particular adjustment needs, contained growth in unit labour costs signals greater price competitiveness and exports are performing better. governments should build on the progress achieved in fiscal consolidation, strengthen competition in product markets and continue with labour market reforms. this would boost the euro area’s growth potential, reduce high structural unemployment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged hicp_inflation rate decline far anticipate

hicp inflation rates have declined over recent months, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% this year. over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the economic weakness in the euro area is expected to extend into 2013. in particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors and persistent uncertainty will continue to weigh on economic activity. later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover. in particular, our accommodative monetary policy stance, together with significantly improved financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, should work its way through to the economy, and global demand should strengthen. in order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following a contraction of 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, euro area real gdp declined by 0.1% in the third quarter. available statistics and survey indicators continue to signal further weakness in activity, which is expected to extend into this year, reflecting the adverse impact on domestic expenditure of weak consumer and investor sentiment and subdued foreign demand. however, more recently several conjunctural indicators have broadly stabilised, albeit at low levels, and financial market confidence has improved significantly. later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start, as our accommodative monetary policy stance, the significant improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation work their way through to private domestic expenditure, and a strengthening of foreign demand should support export growth.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. they are mainly related to slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries. these factors have the potential to dampen sentiment for longer than currently assumed and delay further the recovery of private investment, employment and consumption.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.2% in december 2012, unchanged from november and down from 2.5% in october and 2.6% in august and september. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% this year. over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain contained.  risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 remained broadly unchanged at 3.8% in november 2012, after 3.9% in october. m3 growth continued to be driven by a preference for liquid assets, as m1 growth increased further to 6.7% in november, from 6.5% in october, reflecting inflows into overnight deposits from households and non-financial corporations. following our non-standard monetary policy measures and action by other policy-makers, a broadly based strengthening in the deposit base of mfis in a number of stressed countries was observed. this allowed several mfis to reduce further their reliance on eurosystem funding and helped to reduce segmentation in financial markets. m3 growth was also supported by an inflow of capital into the euro area, as reflected in the strong increase in the net external asset position of mfis.  there has been little change in credit growth, which remained weak in november. the annual rate of decline in loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at -0.5% in november. this development reflects further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations. net redemptions, however, were less pronounced than in previous months, amounting to €4 billion in november, after €7 billion in october and €21 billion in september. the annual rate of decline in loans to non-financial corporations was -1.4% in november, after ‑1.5% in october. the annual growth in mfi lending to households also remained broadly unchanged at 0.7% in november. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises.  in order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. the future

developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. other economic policy areas will need to make further contributions to ensure a firm stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. further structural reforms should be rapidly implemented to make the euro area a more flexible, dynamic and competitive economy. in particular, product market reforms to increase competition and competitiveness are essential, accompanied by measures to improve the functioning of labour markets. such reforms will boost the euro area’s growth potential and employment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries. they will also add further momentum to the progress being made with regard to unit labour costs and current account imbalances. as regards fiscal policies, the recent significant decline in sovereign bond yields should be bolstered by further progress in fiscal consolidation in line with the commitments under the stability and growth pact",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is121206.en.html,6 December 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, hicp inflation rates have been elevated for some time. more recently they have declined, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% in 2013. over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation rates should remain in line with price stability. the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the economic weakness in the euro area is expected to extend into next year. in particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors and persistent uncertainty will continue to weigh on economic activity. later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, as global demand strengthens and our accommodative monetary policy stance and significantly improved financial market confidence work their way through to the economy. in order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. today, we have also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (mros) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2013 on 9 july 2013. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2013. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. the rates in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations, to be allotted until june 2013, will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective longer-term refinancing operation.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following a contraction of 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, euro area real gdp declined by 0.1% in the third quarter. available statistics and survey indicators continue to signal further weakness in activity in the last quarter of the year, although more recently some indicators have stabilised at low levels and financial market confidence has improved further. over the shorter term, weak activity is expected to extend into next year, reflecting the adverse impact on domestic expenditure of weak consumer and investor sentiment and subdued foreign demand. a gradual recovery should start later in 2013 as our accommodative monetary policy stance and significant improvement in financial market confidence work their way through to private domestic expenditure, and a strengthening of foreign demand should support export growth. this assessment is reflected in the december 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between -0.6% and -0.4% for 2012, between -0.9% and 0.3% for 2013 and between 0.2% and 2.2% for 2014. compared with the september 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for 2012 and 2013 have been revised downwards.  the governing council continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area. these are mainly related to uncertainties about the resolution of sovereign debt and governance issues in the euro area, geopolitical issues and fiscal policy decisions in the united states possibly dampening sentiment for longer than currently assumed and delaying further the recovery of private investment, employment and consumption.  according to eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation fell to 2.2% in november 2012, down from 2.5% in october and from 2.6% in the two previous months. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% next year. over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate.  this assessment is also reflected in the december 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation of 2.5% for 2012, between 1.1% and 2.1% for 2013 and between 0.6% and 2.2% for 2014. compared with the september 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection range for 2013 has been revised downwards.  in the governing council’s assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as broadly balanced, with downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued, taking into account developments over several months. most recently, the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 3.9% in october, from 2.6% in september, while m1 growth accelerated to 6.4% from 5.0% over the same period. these developments are partly due to a specific transaction leading to an increase in overnight deposits belonging to the non-monetary financial sector. at the same time, deposits from households and non-financial corporations also rose in october. overall, more observations are needed to distinguish between shorter-term volatility and more lasting factors.  unlike in the case of monetary developments, there has been little change in credit growth. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at -0.4% in october, unchanged from september. but this development reflects further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations, which led to an annual rate of decline in these loans of -1.5%, down from ‑1.2% in september. the annual growth in mfi lending to households remained unchanged at 0.8% in october. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for gdp, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. furthermore, in a number of euro area countries, capital constraints, risk perception and the segmentation of financial markets restrict credit supply.  in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. a single supervisory mechanism (ssm) is one of the main building blocks. it is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. further economic policy measures and progress in the reform of european governance should help to support financial market sentiment and improve the outlook for economic growth. in this context, the governing council looks forward to the roadmap towards genuine economic and monetary union to be decided at the european council meeting on 13-14 december 2012. initiatives to accelerate structural reforms that help restore competitiveness are particularly important to revive the growth potential of euro area countries and to increase employment. more generally, all euro area countries must ensure that their product and labour markets possess the adjustment capacity required for their smooth and effective functioning within a monetary union. finally, continued fiscal consolidation is expected to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the stability and growth pact and the 2012 european semester recommendations. significant progress has already been made in reducing domestic and external imbalances and in improving competitiveness. continued policy actions on the european, structural and fiscal reform fronts should be mutually

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is121108.en.html,8 November 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2% for the remainder of 2012. they are expected to fall below that level in the course of next year and to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain weak, although it continues to be supported by our monetary policy stance and financial market confidence has visibly improved on the back of our decisions as regards outright monetary transactions (omts). at the same time, the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in large parts of the financial and non-financial sectors as well as high uncertainty continue to weigh on the economic outlook. it is essential for governments to support confidence by forcefully implementing the necessary steps to reduce both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. the governing council remains firmly committed to preserving the singleness of its monetary policy and to ensuring the proper transmission of the policy stance to the real economy throughout the euro area. as we said before, we are ready to undertake omts, which will help to avoid extreme scenarios, thereby clearly reducing concerns about the materialisation of destructive forces.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp contracted by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, following flat growth in the previous quarter. as regards the second half of 2012, the available indicators continue to signal weak activity. while industrial production data showed some resilience in july/august, most recent survey evidence for the economy as a whole, extending into the fourth quarter, does not signal improvements towards the end of the year.  looking ahead to next year, the growth momentum is expected to remain weak. it continues to be supported by our standard and non-standard monetary policy measures, but the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and an uneven global recovery will continue to dampen the pace of recovery. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.5% in october 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.6% in september and august. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates could remain at elevated levels, before declining to below 2% again in the course of next year. over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. current levels of inflation should thus remain transitory. we will continue to monitor closely further developments in costs, wages and prices. risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes owing to the need for fiscal consolidation. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, in the event of a renewed intensification of financial market tensions, and its effects on the domestic components of inflation.  turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. in september the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 2.7%, from 2.8% in august. monthly outflows from m3 reflected to some extent the reversal of portfolio shifts into the most liquid components of m3. accordingly, the annual rate of growth of m1 declined to 5.0% in september, from 5.2% in august. at the same time, we have observed a strengthening in the deposit base of banks in some stressed countries, amid improvements in investors’ confidence in the euro area.  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined further to -0.4% in september, from -0.2% in august. this development was mainly due to further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations, which led to an annual rate of decline in these loans of -1.2%, compared with -0.5% in august. the annual growth in mfi lending to households remained unchanged at 0.9% in september. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for gdp, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. at the same time, in a number of euro area countries, the segmentation of financial markets and capital constraints for banks restrict credit supply. the recent results of the bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2012 underpin this assessment. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels, thereby contributing to an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions of the non-financial sectors in the individual countries of the euro area. it is thus essential that the resilience of banks continues to be strengthened where needed.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. other economic policy areas need to make substantial contributions to ensure a further stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. structural reforms are crucial to boost the growth potential of euro area countries and to enhance employment. policy action is also necessary to increase the adjustment capacity of euro area economies in order to complete the ongoing process of unwinding existing imbalances. visible progress is being made in the correction of unit labour costs and current account imbalances. however, further measures to enhance labour market flexibility and labour mobility across the euro area are warranted. such structural measures would also complement and support fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. as regards fiscal policies, there is clear evidence that consolidation efforts in euro area countries are bearing fruit. it is crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the stability and growth pact and the 2012 european semester recommendations. full compliance with the reinforced eu fiscal and governance framework, including the rapid implementation of the fiscal compact, will send a strong signal to markets and strengthen confidence in the soundness of public finances.  the governing council takes note of the european council conclusions on completing economic and monetary union, adopted on 18 october 2012. in the context of measures to achieve an integrated financial framework, it welcomes in particular the objective of agreeing on the legislative framework for a single supervisory mechanism (ssm) by 1 january 2013 with a view to the ssm becoming operational in

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is121004.en.html,4 October 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation rates are expected to remain above 2% throughout 2012, but then to fall below that level again in the course of next year and to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain weak, with ongoing tensions in some euro area financial markets and high uncertainty still weighing on confidence and sentiment. our decisions as regards outright monetary transactions (omts) have helped to alleviate such tensions over the past few weeks, thereby reducing concerns about the materialisation of destructive scenarios. it is now essential that governments continue to implement the necessary steps to reduce both fiscal and structural imbalances and proceed with financial sector restructuring measures.  the governing council remains firmly committed to preserving the singleness of its monetary policy and to ensuring the proper transmission of the policy stance to the real economy throughout the euro area. omts will enable us to provide, under appropriate conditions, a fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area. let me repeat again what i have said in past months: we act strictly within our mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term; we act independently in determining monetary policy; and the euro is irreversible. we are ready to undertake omts, once all the prerequisites are in place. as we said last month, the governing council will consider entering into omts to the extent that they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected. we would exit from omts once their objectives have been achieved or when there is a failure to comply with a programme. omts would not take place while a given programme is under review and would resume after the review period once programme compliance has been assured.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp contracted by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, following flat growth in the previous quarter. economic indicators, in particular survey results, confirm the continuation of weak economic activity in the third quarter of 2012, in an environment characterised by high uncertainty. we expect the euro area economy to remain weak in the near term and to recover only very gradually thereafter. the growth momentum is supported by our standard and non-standard monetary policy measures, but is expected to remain dampened by the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, the existence of high unemployment and an uneven global recovery.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. they relate, in particular, to ongoing tensions in several euro area financial markets and the potential spillover to the euro area real economy. these risks should be contained by effective action by all policy-makers in the euro area.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.7% in september 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.6% in the previous month. this is higher than expected and mainly reflects past increases in indirect taxes and euro-denominated energy prices. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates could remain at elevated levels, before declining to below 2% again in the course of next year. over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. current levels of inflation should thus remain transitory and not give rise to second-round effects. we will continue to monitor closely further developments in costs, wages and prices.  risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes owing to the need for fiscal consolidation. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, in the event of a renewed intensification of financial market tensions, and its effects on the domestic components of inflation. if not contained by effective action by all policy-makers in the euro area, such intensification has the potential to affect the balance of risks on the downside.  turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the subdued underlying pace of monetary expansion. in august the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 2.9%, from 3.6% in july. while this decline was mainly due to a base effect, monthly inflows were also relatively contained. conversely, strong monthly inflows into overnight deposits contributed to a further increase in the annual rate of growth of m1 to 5.1% in august, compared with 4.5% in july. this increase reflects a continuing high preference for liquidity in an environment of low interest rates and high uncertainty.  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined in august to -0.2% (from 0.1% in july), reflecting a decrease in the annual rate of growth of loans to non-financial corporations to -0.5%, from -0.2% in july. by contrast, the annual growth of loans to households remained unchanged, at 1.0%, in august. to a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for gdp, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. at the same time, in a number of euro area countries, the segmentation of financial markets and capital constraints for banks restrict credit supply.  the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels, thereby contributing to an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions of the non-financial sectors in the different countries of the euro area. it is thus essential that the resilience of banks continues to be strengthened where needed. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. other economic policy areas need to make substantial contributions to ensure a further stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. as regards fiscal policies, euro area countries are progressing with consolidation. it is crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the stability and growth pact and the 2012 european semester recommendations. a rapid implementation of the fiscal compact will also play a major role in strengthening confidence in the soundness of public finances. at the same time, structural reforms are as essential as fiscal consolidation efforts and measures to improve the functioning of the financial sector. in the countries most strongly affected by the crisis, noticeable progress is being made in the correction of unit labour cost and current account developments. decisive product and labour market reforms will further improve the competitiveness of these countries and their capacity to adjust.  finally, it is essential to push ahead with european institution-building. the ecb welcomes the commission proposal of 12 september 2012 for a single supervisory mechanism (ssm) involving the ecb, to be established through a council regulation on the basis of article 127(6) of the treaty. the governing council considers an ssm to be one of the fundamental pillars of a financial union and one of the main building blocks towards a genuine economic and monetary union. we will formally issue a legal opinion in which we will, in particular, take into account the following principles: a clear and robust separation between supervisory decision-making and monetary policy; appropriate accountability channels; a decentralisation of tasks within the ssm; an effective supervisory framework ensuring coherent oversight of the euro area banking system; and full compatibility with the single market framework, including the role and prerogatives of the european banking authority. as the commission proposal sets out an ambitious transition schedule towards the ssm, the ecb has started preparatory work so as to be able to implement the provisions of the council regulation as soon as it enters into force",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120906.en.html,6 September 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation rates are expected to remain above 2% throughout 2012, to fall below that level again in the course

expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain weak, with the ongoing tensions in financial markets and heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment. a renewed intensification of financial market tensions would have the potential to affect the balance of risks for both growth and inflation.  it is against this background that the governing council today decided on the modalities for undertaking outright monetary transactions (omts) in secondary markets for sovereign bonds in the euro area. as we said a month ago, we need to be in the position to safeguard the monetary policy transmission mechanism in all countries of the euro area. we aim to preserve the singleness of our monetary policy and to ensure the proper transmission of our policy stance to the real economy throughout the area. omts will enable us to address severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro. hence, under appropriate conditions, we will have a fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area. let me repeat what i said last month: we act strictly within our mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term; we act independently in determining monetary policy; and the euro is irreversible.  in order to restore confidence, policy-makers in the euro area need to push ahead with great determination with fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and european institution-building. at the same time, governments must stand ready to activate the efsf/esm in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist – with strict and effective conditionality in line with the established guidelines. the adherence of governments to their commitments and the fulfilment by the efsf/esm of their role are necessary conditions for our outright transactions to be conducted and to be effective. details of the outright monetary transactions are described in a separate press release.  furthermore, the governing council took decisions with a view to ensuring the availability of adequate collateral in eurosystem refinancing operations. the details of these measures are also elaborated in a separate press release. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. recently published statistics indicate that euro area real gdp contracted by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, following zero growth in the previous quarter. economic indicators point to continued weak economic activity in the remainder of 2012, in an environment of heightened uncertainty. looking beyond the short term, we expect the euro area economy to recover only very gradually. the growth momentum is expected to remain dampened by the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, the existence of high unemployment and an uneven global recovery.  the september 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between -0.6% and -0.2% for 2012 and between -0.4% and 1.4% for 2013. compared with the june 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for 2012 and 2013 have been revised downwards. the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area are assessed to be on the downside. they relate, in particular, to the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. these risks should be contained by effective action by all euro area policy-makers.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.6% in august 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. this increase is mainly due to renewed increases in euro-denominated energy prices. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates could turn out somewhat higher than expected a few months ago, but they should decline to below 2% again in the course of next year. over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate.  the september 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.4% and 2.6% for 2012 and between 1.3% and 2.5% for 2013. these projection ranges are somewhat higher than those contained in the june 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes owing to the need for fiscal consolidation. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, particularly resulting from a further intensification of financial market tensions, and its effects on the domestic components of inflation. if not contained by effective action by all euro area policy-makers, such intensification has the potential to affect the balance of risks on the downside.  turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remained subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 3.8% in july 2012, up from 3.2% in june. the rise in m3 growth was mainly attributable to a higher preference for liquidity, as reflected in the further increase in the annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate m1 to 4.5% in july, from 3.5% in june. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained weak at 0.5% in july (after 0.3% in june). annual growth in mfi loans to both non-financial corporations and households remained subdued, at -0.2% and 1.1% respectively (both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation). to a large extent, subdued loan growth reflects a weak outlook for gdp, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. furthermore, in a number of euro area countries, the segmentation of financial markets and capital constraints for banks continue to weigh on credit supply.  looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience where this is needed. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. although good progress is being made, the need for structural and fiscal adjustment remains significant in many european countries. on the structural side, further swift and decisive product and labour market reforms are required across the euro area to improve competitiveness, increase adjustment capacities and achieve higher sustainable growth rates. these structural reforms will also complement and support fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. on the fiscal front, it is crucial that governments undertake all measures necessary to achieve their targets for the current and coming years. in this respect, the expected rapid implementation of the fiscal compact should be a main element to help strengthen confidence in the soundness of public finances. finally, pushing ahead with european institution-building with great determination is essential",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120802.en.html,2 August 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged, following the decrease of 25 basis points in july. as we said a month ago, inflation should decline further in the course of 2012 and be below 2% again in 2013. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at the same time, economic growth in the euro area remains weak, with the ongoing tensions in financial markets and heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment. a further intensification of financial market tensions has the potential to affect the balance of risks for both growth and inflation on the downside.  the governing council extensively discussed the policy options to address the severe malfunctioning in the price formation process in the bond markets of euro area countries. exceptionally high risk premia are observed in government bond prices in several countries and financial fragmentation hinders the effective working of monetary policy. risk premia that are related to fears of the reversibility of the euro are unacceptable, and they need to be addressed in a fundamental manner. the euro is irreversible.  in order to create the fundamental conditions for such risk premia to disappear, policy-makers in the euro area need to push ahead with fiscal consolidation, structural reform and european institution-building with great determination. as implementation takes time and financial markets often only adjust once success becomes clearly visible, governments must stand ready to activate the efsf/esm in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist – with strict and effective conditionality in line with the established guidelines.  the adherence of governments to their commitments and the fulfilment by the efsf/esm of their role are necessary conditions. the governing council, within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective. in this context, the concerns of private investors about seniority will be addressed. furthermore, the governing council may consider undertaking further non-standard monetary policy measures according to what is required to repair monetary policy transmission. over the coming weeks, we will design the appropriate modalities for such policy measures.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. on a quarterly basis, euro area real gdp growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012, following a decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter. economic indicators point to weak economic activity in the second quarter of 2012 and at the beginning of the third quarter, in an environment of heightened uncertainty. looking beyond the short term, we expect the euro area economy to recover only very gradually, with growth momentum being further dampened by a number of factors. in particular, tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on financing conditions, the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment are expected to weigh on the underlying growth momentum, which is also affected by the ongoing global slowdown.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. they relate, in particular, to the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to possible renewed increases in energy prices over the medium term. euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.4% in july 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from the previous month. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates should decline further in the course of 2012 and be below 2% again in 2013. over the policy‑relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well‑anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate.  risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation, and higher than expected energy prices over the medium term. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, in particular resulting from a further intensification of financial market tensions. such intensification has the potential to affect the balance of risks on the downside. turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remained subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 stood at 3.2% in june 2012, slightly higher than the 3.1% observed in the previous month and close to the rate observed at the end of the first quarter. overall, inflows into broad money in the second quarter were weak. annual growth in m1 increased further to 3.5% in june, in line with the increased preference of investors for liquid instruments in an environment of low interest rates and high uncertainty.  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined to 0.3% in june (from 0.5% in may). as net redemptions of loans to non-financial corporations and households (both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) were observed in june, the annual growth rates for loans to both non‑financial corporations and households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) decreased further in june, to -0.3% and 1.1% respectively. to a large extent, subdued loan growth reflects the current cyclical situation, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. a considerable contribution of demand factors to weak mfi loan growth is confirmed by the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2012. this survey also shows that the net tightening of banks’ credit standards at the euro area level was broadly stable in the second quarter of 2012, as compared with the previous quarter, for loans to both enterprises and households. looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience where this is needed. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. while significant progress has been achieved with fiscal consolidation over recent years, further decisive and urgent steps need to be taken to improve competitiveness. from 2009 to 2011, euro area countries, on average, reduced the deficit-to-gdp ratio by 2.3 percentage points, and the primary deficit improved by about 2½ percentage points. fiscal adjustment in the euro area is continuing in 2012, and it is indeed crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions. at the same time, structural reforms are as essential as fiscal consolidation efforts and the measures to repair the financial sector. some progress has also been made in this area. for example, unit labour costs and current account developments have started to undergo a correction process in most of the countries strongly affected by the crisis. however, further reform measures need to be implemented swiftly and decisively. product market reforms to foster competitiveness and the creation of efficient and flexible labour markets are preconditions for the unwinding of existing imbalances and the achievement of robust, sustainable growth. it is now crucial that member states implement their country-specific recommendations with determination",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged follow decrease point month ago inflation decline far course consistent

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120705.en.html,5 July 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to cut the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. inflationary pressure over the policy-relevant horizon has been dampened further as some of the previously identified downside risks to the euro area growth outlook have materialised. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at the same time, economic growth in the euro area continues to remain weak, with heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment. we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. this combination of measures has supported the transmission of our monetary policy. all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature and we maintain our full capacity to ensure medium-term price stability by acting in a firm and timely manner. let me also remind you of the decision taken by the governing council on 22 june 2012 concerning further measures to increase collateral availability for counterparties. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. on a quarterly basis, euro area real gdp growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012, following a decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter. indicators for the second quarter of 2012 point to a renewed weakening of economic growth and heightened uncertainty. looking beyond the short term we expect the euro area economy to recover gradually, although with momentum dampened by a number of factors. in particular, tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment are expected to weigh on the underlying growth momentum.  the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. they relate, in particular, to a renewed increase in the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to possibly renewed increases in energy prices over the medium term. euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.4% in june 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from the previous month. on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates should decline further in the course of 2012 and be again below 2% in 2013. over the policy‑relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well‑anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate.  taking into account today’s decisions, risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area. upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation, and higher than expected energy prices over the medium term.  turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained subdued, with short-term developments displaying some volatility. the increase in the annual growth rate of m3 to 2.9% in may, up from 2.5% in april and close to the 3.0% observed in march, mainly reflected a reversal of the outflows in april from overnight deposits belonging to non-monetary financial intermediaries (particularly investment funds). in addition to an increased preference for deposits with shorter maturities, these factors have also shaped m1 developments, with the annual growth rate increasing from 1.8% in april to 3.3% in may.  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined to 0.4% in may (from 0.8% in april). annual growth rates for loans to both non‑financial corporations and households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) also decreased in may, to 0.2% and 1.3% respectively, with negative monthly loan flows to non-financial corporations. to a large extent, subdued loan growth reflects the current cyclical situation, heightened risk aversion, and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises which weigh on credit demand.  looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience where it is needed. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. to sum up, taking into account today’s decisions, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. let me now make a few remarks relating to other policies. we welcome the european council conclusions of 29 june 2012 to take action to address financial market tensions, restore confidence and revive growth. we agree that economic and monetary union needs to be put on a more solid basis for the future and that sustainable growth, sound public finances and structural reforms to boost competitiveness remain key economic priorities. we welcome the decision to develop a specific and time-bound road map for the achievement of a genuine economic and monetary union. we also welcome the euro area summit initiative towards a single supervisory mechanism, the possibility – with appropriate conditionality – to recapitalise banks directly, and the use of existing efsf/esm instruments in a flexible and efficient manner in order to stabilise markets. finally, the ecb is ready to serve as an agent to the efsf/esm in conducting market operations",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide cut key_interest_rate point inflationary pressure policy relevant

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120606.en.html,6 June 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. while inflation rates are likely to stay above 2% for the remainder of 2012, over the policy-relevant horizon we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at the same time, economic growth in the euro area remains weak, with heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment, giving rise to increased downside risks to the economic outlook.  in previous months we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. this combination of measures has supported the transmission of our monetary policy. today, we have decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (mros) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the 12th maintenance period of 2012 on 15 january 2013. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. furthermore, the governing council has decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted until the end of 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. keeping in mind that all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature, we will monitor further developments closely and ensure medium-term price stability for the euro area by acting in a firm and timely manner. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. on a quarterly basis, euro area real gdp growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012. available indicators for the second quarter of the year point to a weakening of growth and highlight prevailing uncertainty. looking beyond the short term, we continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually. however, ongoing tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum.  the june 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between -0.5% and 0.3% for 2012 and between 0.0% and 2.0% for 2013. compared with the march 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2012 remains unchanged, while there is a slight narrowing of the range for 2013.  in the governing council’s assessment, the economic outlook for the euro area is subject to increased downside risks relating, in particular, to a further increase in the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to possibly renewed increases in commodity prices over the medium term. euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.4% in may 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.6% in the previous month. inflation is likely to stay above 2% for the remainder of the year, mainly owing to developments in energy prices and indirect taxes. however, on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% again in early 2013. looking ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain subdued.  the june 2012 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.3% and 2.5% for 2012 and between 1.0% and 2.2% for 2013. in comparison with the march 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, there is a narrowing of the projection ranges for 2012 and 2013. the governing council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation, and higher than expected commodity prices over the medium term. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area.  the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remained subdued in the first four months of 2012. the annual growth rate of m3 fell to 2.5% in april, down from 3.1% in march, following strong inflows into money in the first quarter of the year. the moderation in annual m3 growth in april was mainly driven by outflows from overnight deposits belonging to non-monetary financial intermediaries (which includes entities like central counterparties, investment funds and securitisation vehicles).  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined to 0.8% in april (from 1.2% in march), owing to negative loan flows to non-monetary financial intermediaries. at the same time, monthly flows of loans to non-financial corporations and households were moderately positive in april and the annual rates of growth (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.7% and 1.5% respectively in april, broadly unchanged from march.  money and credit data up to april provide evidence that, as intended by our policy measures, an abrupt and disorderly adjustment in the balance sheets of credit institutions has not materialised. given the current cyclical situation and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, subdued credit demand is likely to prevail in the period ahead.  looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience further. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. let me now make a few remarks relating to fiscal and economic policies. significant progress has been achieved with fiscal consolidation over recent years. it is of crucial importance to continue with the efforts to restore sound fiscal positions and to regain competitiveness. these are pre-conditions for stable economic growth. as a natural complement, the implementation of the new macroeconomic surveillance framework under the eu semester is necessary. in several euro area countries, excessive imbalances exist and need to be corrected. to this end, comprehensive product, labour and financial sector reforms will help foster sustainable growth. competition should be strengthened in product markets, not least by the completion of the single market, and wages should adjust in a flexible manner, reflecting labour market conditions and productivity. these growth-enhancing reforms would accelerate the necessary adjustment process and enhance job creation.  finally, the governing council very much welcomes leaders at the last european council meeting agreeing to step up their reflections on the long-term vision for economic and monetary union. the governing council considers this a highly important step",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged inflation rate likely stay remainder policy relevant horizon expect price development remain line price stability

inflation rates are likely to stay above 2% in 2012. however, over the policy-relevant horizon, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. available indicators for the first quarter remain consistent with a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level. latest survey indicators for the euro area highlight prevailing uncertainty. looking ahead, economic activity is expected to recover gradually over the course of the year. at the same time, as we said previously, the economic outlook continues to be subject to downside risks. inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. over the last few months we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. this combination of measures has helped both the financial environment and the transmission of our monetary policy. further developments will be closely monitored, keeping in mind that all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature and that we maintain our full capacity to ensure medium-term price stability by acting in a firm and timely manner.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. available indicators for the first quarter remain consistent with a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level. latest signals from euro area survey data highlight prevailing uncertainty. at the same time, there are indications that the global recovery is proceeding. looking beyond the short term, we continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of the year, supported by foreign demand, the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area economy. however, remaining tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment, are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum.  as we said previously, this economic outlook continues to be subject to downside risks, relating in particular to an intensification of tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy, as well as to further increases in commodity prices.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.6% in april 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.7% in the previous four months. inflation is likely to stay above 2% in 2012, mainly owing to increases in energy prices, as well as to rises in indirect taxes. on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% again in early 2013. in this context, we will pay particular attention to any signs of pass-through from higher energy prices to wages, profits and general price-setting. however, looking ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain limited.  risks to the outlook for hicp inflation rates in the coming years are still seen to be broadly balanced. upside risks pertain to higher than expected commodity prices and indirect tax increases, while downside risks relate to weaker than expected developments in economic activity.  the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained subdued, with somewhat higher growth rates in the past few months. the annual growth rate of m3 was 3.2% in march 2012, compared with 2.8% in february. since january we have observed a strengthening in the deposit base of banks.  the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.5% and 1.7% respectively in march, both slightly lower than in february. the volume of mfi loans to non-financial corporations and households remained practically unchanged compared with the previous month.  money and credit data up to march confirm a broad stabilisation of financial conditions and thereby, as intended by our measures, the avoidance of an abrupt and disorderly adjustment in the balance sheets of credit institutions. in this context, the april bank lending survey indicates that the net tightening of credit standards by euro area banks declined substantially in the first quarter of 2012 as compared with late 2011, for both loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, also on account of improvements in funding conditions for banks. as also indicated in the bank lending survey, the demand for credit remained subdued in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting weak economic activity and the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in non-financial sectors. the full supportive impact of the eurosystem’s non-standard measures will need time to unfold and to have a positive effect on the growth of loans when demand recovers. in this context, it should be noted that the second three-year longer-term refinancing operation was only settled on 1 march 2012. looking ahead, it is essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, including by retaining earnings. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. it is of utmost importance to ensure fiscal sustainability and sustainable growth in the euro area. most euro area countries made good progress in terms of fiscal consolidation in 2011. while the necessary comprehensive fiscal adjustment is weighing on near-term economic growth, its successful implementation will contribute to the sustainability of public finances and thereby to the lowering of sovereign risk premia. in an environment of enhanced confidence in fiscal balances, private sector activity should also be fostered, supporting private investment and medium-term growth.  at the same time, together with fiscal consolidation, growth and growth potential in the euro area need to be enhanced by decisive structural reforms. in this context, facilitating entrepreneurial activities, the start-up of new firms and job creation is crucial. policies aimed at enhancing competition in product markets and increasing the wage and employment adjustment capacity of firms will foster innovation, promote job creation and boost longer-term growth prospects. reforms in these areas are particularly important for countries which have suffered significant losses in cost competitiveness and need to stimulate productivity and improve trade performance.  in this context, let me make a few remarks on the adjustment process within the euro area. as we know from the experience of other large currency areas, regional divergences in economic developments are a normal feature. however, considerable imbalances have accumulated in the last decade in several euro area countries and they are now in the process of being corrected.  as concerns the monetary policy stance of the ecb, it has to be focused on the euro area. our primary objective remains to maintain price stability over the medium term. this is the best contribution of monetary policy to fostering growth and job creation in the euro area.  addressing divergences among individual euro area countries is the task of national governments. they must undertake determined policy actions to address major imbalances and vulnerabilities in the fiscal, financial and structural domains. we note that progress is being made in many countries, but several governments need to be more ambitious. ensuring sound fiscal balances, financial stability and competitiveness in all euro area countries is in our common interest",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged inflation rate likely

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120404.en.html,4 April 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since the beginning of march broadly confirms our previous assessment. inflation rates are likely to stay above 2% in 2012, with upside risks prevailing. over the policy-relevant horizon, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. survey indicators for economic growth have broadly stabilised at low levels in the early months of 2012, and a moderate recovery in activity is expected in the course of the year. the economic outlook remains subject to downside risks.  medium-term inflation expectations for the euro area economy must continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. over the last few months we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. this combination of measures has contributed to a stabilisation in the financial environment and an improvement in the transmission of our monetary policy. we need to carefully monitor further developments. it is also important to keep in mind that all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature and that all the necessary tools are available to address upside risks to medium-term price stability in a firm and timely manner.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp contracted by 0.3% in the euro area in the fourth quarter of 2011. survey data confirm a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level in early 2012. we continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of the year. the outlook for economic activity should be supported by foreign demand, the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area economy. however, the remaining tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment in parts of the euro area, are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum.  downside risks to the economic outlook prevail. they relate in particular to a renewed intensification of tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.6% in march 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.7% in the previous three months. inflation is likely to stay above 2% in 2012, mainly owing to recent increases in energy prices, as well as recently announced rises in indirect taxes. on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% again in early 2013. in this context, we will pay particular attention to any signs of pass-through from higher energy prices to wages, profits and general price-setting. however, looking ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain limited.  risks to the outlook for hicp inflation rates in the coming years are still seen to be broadly balanced, with upside risks in the near term mainly stemming from higher than expected oil prices and indirect tax increases. downside risks continue to exist owing to weaker than expected developments in economic activity.  the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 was 2.8% in february 2012, compared with 2.5% in january. in both january and february we observed a strengthening in the deposit base of banks. annual loan growth to the private sector has remained subdued, with the rate (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) moderating in february to 1.1% year on year, from 1.5% in january.  the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.6% and 1.8% respectively in february. the volume of mfi loans to non-financial corporations and households remained practically unchanged compared with the previous month.  money and credit data up to february confirm a broad stabilisation of financial conditions and thereby the avoidance of an abrupt and disorderly adjustment in the balance sheets of credit institutions, as intended by our measures. funding conditions for banks have generally improved, and there has been increased issuance activity and a re-opening of some segments of funding markets. the demand for credit remains weak in the light of still subdued economic activity and the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in non-financial sectors. the full supportive impact of the eurosystem’s non-standard measures will need time to unfold and to have a positive effect on the growth of loans when demand recovers. in this context, it should be noted that the second three-year longer-term refinancing operation was only settled on 1 march 2012. following the stabilisation in the financial environment, it is essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, including by retaining earnings. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. in order to support confidence, sustainable growth and employment, the governing council calls upon governments to restore sound fiscal positions and implement strong structural reforms. commitments under the stability and growth pact need to be fully honoured and weaknesses in competitiveness forcefully addressed. national policy-makers need to fully meet their responsibilities to ensure fiscal sustainability, to increase the adjustment capacity of product and labour markets, to enhance productivity and competitiveness, and to ensure the soundness of their financial system. in particular, countries which have suffered losses in cost competitiveness need to ensure sufficient wage adjustment and foster productivity growth.  let me conclude by recalling that the single monetary policy naturally focuses on maintaining medium-term price stability for the euro area as a whole. it is up to national policy-makers to foster domestic developments which support the competitiveness of their economies. both prudent fiscal policies and competitive and flexible product and labour markets are of crucial importance for the functioning of the euro area economy",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged information available beginning broadly confirm previous assessment inflation rate

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120308.en.html,8 March 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since the beginning of february has confirmed our previous assessment of the outlook for economic activity. available survey indicators confirm signs of a stabilisation in the euro area economy. however, the economic outlook is still subject to downside risks. owing to rises in energy prices and indirect taxes, inflation rates are now likely to stay above 2% in 2012, with upside risks prevailing. nevertheless, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued, consistent with contained inflationary pressures over the medium term.  looking ahead, we are firmly committed to maintaining price stability in the euro area, in line with our mandate. to this end, the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations – in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term – is of the essence.  over recent months, a wide range of additional non-standard monetary policy measures has been implemented by the eurosystem. these measures, including in particular two three-year longer-term refinancing operations, were decided upon against the background of exceptional circumstances in the last quarter of 2011. the first impact of these measures has been positive. together with fiscal consolidation and stepped-up structural reforms in several euro area countries, as well as progress towards a stronger euro area economic governance framework, they have contributed to a significant improvement in the financial environment over recent months. we expect that the three-year longer-term refinancing operations will provide further support for the ongoing stabilisation in financial markets and, in particular, for lending activity in the euro area. all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature. furthermore, all the necessary tools to address potential upside risks to medium-term price stability are fully available. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp contracted by 0.3% in the euro area in the fourth quarter of 2011. according to recent survey data, there are signs of a stabilisation in economic activity, albeit still at a low level. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of this year. the outlook for economic activity should be supported by foreign demand, the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area financial sector. however, the remaining tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum.  this assessment is also reflected in the march 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between -0.5% and 0.3% in 2012 and between 0.0% and 2.2% in 2013. compared with the december 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been shifted slightly downwards. this outlook remains subject to downside risks. they notably relate to a renewed intensification of tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices.  euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.7% in february 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, slightly up from 2.6% in january. looking ahead, inflation is now likely to stay above 2% in 2012, mainly owing to recent increases in energy prices, as well as recently announced increases in indirect taxes. on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall again to below 2% in early 2013. looking further ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain limited.  the march 2012 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.1% and 2.7% in 2012 and between 0.9% and 2.3% in 2013. in comparison with the december 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for hicp inflation have been shifted upwards, notably the range for 2012. risks to projected hicp inflation rates in the coming years are seen to be still broadly balanced, with upside risks in the near term mainly stemming from higher than expected oil prices and indirect tax increases. however, downside risks continue to exist owing to weaker than expected developments in economic activity. the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 was 2.5% in january 2012, up from 1.5% in december 2011. loan growth to the private sector also remains subdued. however, its annual rate (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) picked up slightly in january to 1.5% year on year from 1.2% in december. the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.8% and 2.1% respectively in january. the volume of mfi loans to non-financial corporations declined only slightly in january, following the pronounced decline in december. by contrast, the flow of loans to households in january was positive.  following the signs of improvement in the financial environment, it is essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, including by retaining earnings. the soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy. to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. looking ahead, in order to deliver a favourable environment for sustainable growth and to support confidence and competitiveness, the governing council stresses the urgent need for governments to make further progress towards restoring sound fiscal positions and implementing the structural reform agenda. regarding fiscal consolidation, many governments in the euro area are making progress. continuing with comprehensive fiscal consolidation and complying with all commitments remains essential. in this respect, the 2012 european semester should be used to enforce rigorously the reinforced fiscal surveillance mechanism. equally important are structural reforms to increase the adjustment capacity and competitiveness of euro area countries and to strengthen growth prospects and job creation. in this area, more progress is desirable. the governing council strongly welcomes the european commission’s alert mechanism report on macroeconomic imbalances and expects the proposed in-depth country reviews to actively support the reform processes under way in euro area countries",base regular economic monetary_analysis decide key_interest_rate unchanged information available beginning confirm previous assessment outlook economic activity available

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120209.en.html,9 February 2012,"based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since mid-january broadly confirms our previous assessment. inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. available survey indicators confirm some tentative signs of a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level around the turn of the year, but the economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and downside risks. the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. looking ahead, it is essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole. this ensures a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution to supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. a very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted.  through our non-standard monetary policy measures we will continue to support the functioning of the euro area financial sector, and thus the financing of the real economy. since the first three-year longer-term refinancing operation (ltro) was conducted in december 2011 we have approved specific national eligibility criteria and risk control measures for the temporary acceptance in a number of countries of additional credit claims as collateral in eurosystem credit operations, which should lead to an increase in available collateral. further details will be provided in a press release to be published today at 3.30 p.m. at the start of the current reserve maintenance period on 18 january 2012 the reserve ratio was reduced, freeing up additional collateral. as stated on previous occasions, all our non-standard measures are temporary in nature. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2011 is likely to have been very weak. according to the survey data for the last two months, there are tentative signs of a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to recover very gradually in the course of 2012. the very low short-term interest rates and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area financial sector are lending support to the euro area economy. moreover, stress in financial markets has diminished in response to our monetary policy measures, but also in response to the progress made towards a stronger euro area governance framework and intensified fiscal consolidation in several euro area countries. however, subdued global demand growth, the remaining tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum.  this outlook is subject to downside risks. they notably relate to tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to possible adverse developments in the global economy, higher than assumed increases in commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the potential for a disorderly correction of global imbalances. euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.7% in january 2012, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from december. the average inflation rate for 2011 was 2.7%, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. looking ahead, inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. this pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weak growth in the euro area and globally, underlying price pressures in the euro area should remain limited.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain broadly balanced. on the upside, they relate to higher than assumed increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, as well as increases in commodity prices. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally.  the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 1.6% in december 2011, after 2.0% in november, reflecting a further weakening of monetary dynamics towards the end of the year.  the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, also decreased further in december, and stood at 1.2% and 1.9% respectively. the volume of mfi loans to both sectors declined in december, and this was particularly pronounced in the case of the non-financial corporate sector. in addition, there are indications that bank lending conditions tightened further, affecting loan supply in several euro area countries in late 2011. it is not yet possible to draw firm conclusions from these developments, particularly given that the impact of the first three-year ltro on bank funding is still unfolding and may not have been fully reflected in the most recent bank lending survey. in addition, other non-standard monetary policy measures announced in december are still to be implemented. accordingly, close scrutiny of credit developments in the period ahead is essential. the soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. it is essential that the implementation of banks’ recapitalisation plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area.  to sum up, the economic analysis indicates that underlying price pressures should remain limited and risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain broadly balanced. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. a combination of structural reforms and fiscal discipline is essential for boosting confidence and delivering a favourable environment for sustainable growth. regarding fiscal policies, all euro area governments need to continue to do their utmost to ensure fiscal sustainability. it is essential that all countries adhere to the fiscal targets they announced for 2012. this should help to anchor expectations of sound fiscal policies and strengthen confidence. the rules guiding the design and implementation of national fiscal policies are being strengthened at the eu level as well as in the legal frameworks of several member states. these are important steps in the right direction. with regard to structural reforms, these are key to increasing the adjustment capacity and competitiveness of euro area countries, thereby strengthening growth prospects and job creation. notably, far-reaching and ambitious reforms should be implemented to foster competition in product markets, particularly in services sectors, while rigidities in labour markets should be reduced and wage flexibility should be enhanced",base regular economic monetary_analysis

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120112.en.html,12 January 2012,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided today to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point decreases on 3 november and 8 december 2011. the information that has become available since early december broadly confirms our previous assessment. inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. at the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. as expected, ongoing financial market tensions continue to dampen economic activity in the euro area, while, according to some recent survey indicators, there are tentative signs of a stabilisation in activity at low levels. the economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. in such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest and inflation rates should develop in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. overall, it is essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. a very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted.  the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to support euro area banks, and thus the financing of the real economy. the extensive recourse to the first three-year refinancing operation indicates that our non-standard policy measures are providing a substantial contribution to improving the funding situation of banks, thereby supporting financing conditions and confidence. in addition, we are actively working towards the implementation of all the measures announced at our december meeting, which should provide additional support to the economy. as stated on previous occasions, all the non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area grew by 0.1% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2011. at present, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area. they include moderate global demand growth and weak business and consumer confidence in the euro area. domestic demand is likely to be dampened by the ongoing tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors. at the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to recover, albeit very gradually, in the course of 2012, supported by developments in global demand, very low short-term interest rates and all the measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector.  in the governing council’s assessment, substantial downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area continue to exist in an environment of high uncertainty. they notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to the global economy, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.8% in december 2011, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 3.0% in the preceding three months. this decline was expected and reflects a downward base effect stemming from energy prices. inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of 2010, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. this pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker growth in the euro area and globally, underlying cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest.  the governing council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. on the upside, the main risks relate to further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and possible increases in commodity prices. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally.  turning to the monetary analysis, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 2.0% in november 2011, after 2.6% in october. as in the previous three months, monetary developments in november were affected by the heightened uncertainty in financial markets.  the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, decreased to 1.9% in november, from 3.0% in october. the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, both moderated in november, and stood at 1.8% and 2.3% respectively, with slightly negative monthly flows observed for mfi loans to non-financial corporations. overall, despite the moderation in loan growth, the figures on lending do not so far suggest that the heightened financial market tensions led to a sizeable curtailment of credit in the euro area as a whole in the period to november. at the same time, given that credit supply effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. the soundness of bank balance sheets, supported by the increase in capital positions, will be a key factor in facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. it is essential that the implementation of banks’ recapitalisation plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area.  to sum up, incoming information broadly confirms our previous assessment. inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. as expected, ongoing financial market tensions continue to dampen economic activity in the euro area, while, according to some recent survey indicators, there are tentative signs of a stabilisation in activity at low levels. the economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. in such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest and inflation rates should develop in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture, with the underlying pace of monetary expansion continuing to be moderate. turning to fiscal policies, euro area governments need to do their utmost to support fiscal sustainability by correcting excessive deficits in accordance with the agreed timetables and by moving to a structural balanced budget or surplus position over the medium term. slippages in the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans of vulnerable countries must be corrected swiftly by structural fiscal improvements. with regard to the new provisions of the eu economic governance framework that recently came into force, it is crucial that all the elements be implemented rigorously. only ambitious policies to prevent and correct macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances will foster public confidence in the soundness of policy actions, and thus strengthen overall economic sentiment.  the governing council welcomes the european council’s agreement to move to a stronger economic union, which was announced on 9 december 2011. the new fiscal compact, comprising a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made, is an important contribution to ensuring the long-run sustainability of public finances in the euro area countries. the wording of the rules needs to be unambiguous and effective. the further development of the european financial stability tools should make the operation of the european financial stability facility and the european stability mechanism more effective. the swift deployment of these tools is now urgently needed. concerning the involvement of the private sector in financial assistance for indebted countries, we welcome the reaffirmation that the decisions taken on 21 july and 26 and 27 october 2011 concerning greek debt are unique and exceptional.  to accompany fiscal consolidation, the governing council calls for the urgent implementation of bold and ambitious structural reforms. going hand in hand, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. key reforms should be rapidly carried out to help the euro area countries to improve competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. product market reforms should focus on fully opening up markets to increased competition. labour market reforms should focus on removing rigidities and enhancing wage flexibility",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide today key_interest_rate unchanged follow point decrease information available early broadly confirm

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is111208.en.html,8 December 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to lower the  key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points, following the 25 basis point decrease on 3 november 2011. inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. the intensified financial market tensions are continuing to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. in such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. overall, it is essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area.  in its continued efforts to support the liquidity situation of euro area banks, and following the coordinated central bank action on 30 november 2011 to provide liquidity to the global financial system, the governing council today also decided to adopt further non-standard measures. these measures should ensure enhanced access of the banking sector to liquidity and facilitate the functioning of the euro area money market. they are expected to support the provision of credit to households and non-financial corporations. in this context, the governing council decided: first, to conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) with a maturity of 36 months and the option of early repayment after one year. the operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rate in these operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective operation. interest will be paid when the respective operation matures. the first operation will be allotted on 21 december 2011 and will replace the 12-month ltro announced on 6 october 2011. second, to increase collateral availability by reducing the rating threshold for certain asset-backed securities (abs). in addition to the abs that are already eligible for eurosystem operations, abs having a second best rating of at least “single a” in the eurosystem harmonised credit scale at issuance, and at all times subsequently, and the underlying assets of which comprise residential mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, will be eligible for use as collateral in eurosystem credit operations. moreover, national central banks will be allowed, as a temporary solution, to accept as collateral additional performing credit claims (namely bank loans) that satisfy specific eligibility criteria. the responsibility entailed in the acceptance of such credit claims will be borne by the national central bank authorising their use. these measures will take effect as soon as the relevant legal acts have been published.  third, to reduce the reserve ratio, which is currently 2%, to 1%. this will free up collateral and support money market activity. as a consequence of the full allotment policy applied in the ecb’s main refinancing operations and the way banks are using this option, the system of reserve requirements is not needed to the same extent as under normal circumstances to steer money market conditions. this measure will take effect as of the maintenance period starting on 18 january 2012. fourth, to discontinue for the time being, as of the maintenance period starting on 14 december 2011, the fine-tuning operations carried out on the last day of each maintenance period. this is a technical measure to support money market activity.  a detailed press release will be published at 3.30 p.m. today on the ecb’s website. as stated on previous occasions, all the non-standard monetary policy measures are, by construction, temporary in nature. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp in the euro area grew by 0.2% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2011, unchanged from the previous quarter. evidence from survey data points to weaker economic activity in the fourth quarter of this year. a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area. they include a moderation in the pace of global demand growth and unfavourable effects on overall financing conditions and on confidence resulting from ongoing tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors. at the same time, we expect euro area economic activity to recover, albeit very gradually, in the course of next year, supported by resilient global demand, very low short-term interest rates and all the measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector.  this assessment is also reflected in the december 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% in 2011, between -0.4% and 1.0% in 2012 and between 0.3% and 2.3% in 2013. compared with the september 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, there is a narrowing of the range of the real gdp growth projection for 2011 and a significant downward revision of the range for 2012. these revisions mainly reflect the impact on domestic demand of weaker confidence and worsening financing conditions, stemming from the heightened uncertainty related to the sovereign debt crisis, as well as downward revisions of foreign demand.  in the governing council’s assessment, substantial downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area exist in an environment of high uncertainty. downside risks notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to the global economy, which may be weaker than expected, as well as to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 3.0% in november, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from the two previous months. inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. this pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker growth in the euro area and globally, underlying cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should also remain modest.  this assessment is also reflected in the december 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.6% and 2.8% for 2011, between 1.5% and 2.5% for 2012 and between 0.8% and 2.2% for 2013. compared with the september 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the projection ranges for 2011 and 2012 have been revised slightly upwards. this results from the upward impact of higher oil prices in euro terms, as well as a higher contribution from indirect taxes. the upward impact of these factors is expected to more than compensate the downward adjustments to profit margins and wage growth that are related to the downward revision of activity. the governing council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. on the upside, the main risks relate to further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 2.6% in october 2011, after 3.0% in september. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, increased to 3.0% in october, compared with 2.7% in september. as in the previous two months, the monetary data for october reflect the heightened uncertainty in financial markets.  on the counterpart side, the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained broadly unchanged in october, at 2.3% and 2.5% respectively. the unadjusted growth rates were lower, owing to substantial securitisation activities in october. overall, the figures on lending do not suggest that the heightened financial market tensions have significantly affected the supply of credit in the period to october. however, given that credit supply effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and looking through short-term volatility, overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. the soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in reducing potential negative feedback loop effects related to tensions in financial markets, thereby facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. the agreement of the european council of 26 october to proceed with the increase in the capital position of banks to 9% of core tier 1 by the end of june 2012 should improve the euro area banking sector’s resilience over the medium term. in this respect, it is essential that national supervisors ensure that the implementation of banks’ recapitalisation plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area. to sum up, inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. intensified financial market tensions are continuing to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. in such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon. a cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture, with the underlying pace of monetary expansion remaining moderate. turning to fiscal policies, all euro area governments urgently need to do their utmost to support fiscal sustainability in the euro area as a whole. a new fiscal compact, comprising a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made, is the most important precondition for restoring the normal functioning of financial markets. policy-makers need to correct excessive deficits and move to balanced budgets in the coming years by specifying and implementing the necessary adjustment measures. this will support public confidence in the soundness of policy actions and thus strengthen overall economic sentiment.  to accompany fiscal consolidation, the governing council has repeatedly called for bold and ambitious structural reforms. going hand in hand, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. key reforms should be immediately carried out to help the euro area countries to improve competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. labour market reforms should focus on removing rigidities and enhancing wage flexibility",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide lower key_interest_rate point follow point decrease inflation likely stay month come decline intensify financial market tension

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is111103.en.html,3 November 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. while inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, inflation rates are expected to decline further in the course of 2012 to below 2%. at the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. after today’s decision, inflation should remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. owing to their unfavourable effects on financing conditions and confidence, the ongoing tensions in financial markets are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year and beyond. the economic outlook continues to be subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. some of these risks have been materialising, which makes a significant downward revision to forecasts and projections for average real gdp growth in 2012 very likely. in such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate; today’s decision takes this into account. overall, it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. all the non-standard monetary policy measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp growth in the euro area, which slowed in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2% quarter on quarter, is expected to be very moderate in the second half of this year. there are signs that previously identified downside risks have been materialising, as reflected in unfavourable evidence from survey data. looking forward, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global demand and unfavourable effects on overall financing conditions and on confidence resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. at the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from continued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, as well as from the low short-term interest rates and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector.  in the governing council’s assessment, the downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area are confirmed in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. downside risks notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to further spill over into the euro area real economy. they also relate to the impact of the still high energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 3.0% in october according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from september. inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, before falling below 2% in the course of 2012. inflation rates are expected to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. this pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker euro area and global growth, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate.  the governing council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced, taking also into account today’s decision. on the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. in the current environment, however, inflationary pressure should abate. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. in fact, if sustained, sluggish economic growth has the potential to reduce medium-term inflationary pressure in the euro area.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 3.1% in september 2011, up from 2.7% in august. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, was 2.7% in september, unchanged from august. as in august, inflows into m3 also reflect the heightened tensions in some financial markets. in particular, inflows into money market fund shares/units, as well as into repurchase agreements conducted through central counterparties, appear to have significantly affected monetary developments in september. the annual growth rate of m1 increased to 2.0% in september, from 1.7% in august. on the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations and to households in september, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained broadly unchanged compared with august, at 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. these figures do not signal that the heightened financial market tensions have affected the supply of credit up to september. however, as such effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and looking through short-term volatility, underlying broad money and loan growth have stabilised over recent months. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion thus remains moderate.  the overall size of monetary financial institutions’ balance sheets remained broadly unchanged over the past few months. the soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in reducing potential negative feedback loop effects related to tensions in financial markets, thereby facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. we therefore welcome the agreement of the european council to proceed with the increase in the capital position of banks to 9% of core tier 1 by the end of june 2012. we also fully support the call to national supervisors to ensure that banks' recapitalisation plans do not lead to excessive deleveraging. to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. while inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, inflation rates are expected to decline further in the course of 2012 to below 2%. a cross-check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. after today’s decision, inflation should remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. owing to their unfavourable effects on financing conditions and confidence, the ongoing tensions in financial markets are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year and beyond. the economic outlook continues to be subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. some of these risks have been materialising, which makes a significant downward revision to forecasts and projections for average real gdp growth in 2012 very likely. in such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate; today’s decision takes this into account. overall, it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. turning to fiscal policies, all euro area governments need to show their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature as a key element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. the governing council takes note of the fiscal commitments expressed in the euro summit statement of 26 october 2011 and urges all governments to implement fully and as quickly as possible the measures necessary to achieve fiscal consolidation and sustainable pension systems, as well as to improve governance. the governments of countries under joint eu-imf adjustment programmes and those of countries that are particularly vulnerable should stand ready to take any additional measures that become necessary.  it is crucial that fiscal consolidation and structural reforms go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. the governing council therefore calls upon all euro area governments to accelerate, urgently, the implementation of substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. this will help the euro area countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. in this respect, labour market reforms are essential and should focus on measures to remove rigidities and to enhance wage flexibility, so that wages and working conditions can be tailored to the specific needs of firms. more generally, in these demanding times, moderation is of the essence in terms of both profit margins and wages. these measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector. at the same time, the governing council stresses that it is absolutely imperative that euro area national authorities rapidly adopt and implement the measures announced and recommended in the euro summit statement of 26 october 2011",base regular

rates unchanged. inflation has remained elevated and incoming information has confirmed our view that inflation is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead but to decline thereafter. at the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavourable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year. the economic outlook remains subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. at the same time, short-term interest rates remain low. it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. a very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted.  the governing council has decided to conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (ltros), one with a maturity of approximately 12 months in october and the other with a maturity of approximately 13 months in december. the operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rate in both operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations (mros) over the life of the respective ltro, and interest will be paid when each operation matures. these operations will be conducted in addition to the regular and special-term refinancing operations, which remain unaffected.  the governing council has also decided to continue conducting its mros as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2012 on 10 july 2012. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period (i.e. around the end of the second quarter) of 2012. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. in addition, the governing council has decided to conduct the three-month ltros to be allotted on 25 january, 29 february, 28 march, 25 april, 30 may and 27 june 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. furthermore, the governing council has decided to launch a new covered bond purchase programme (cbpp2). the programme will have the following modalities: the purchases will be for an intended amount of eur 40 billion.  the purchases will have the capacity to be conducted in the primary and secondary markets and will be carried out by means of direct purchases. the purchases will start in november 2011 and are expected to be fully implemented by the end of october 2012. further details on the modalities of cbpp2 will be announced after the governing council meeting of 3 november 2011. the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. real gdp growth in the euro area, after slowing in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2% quarter on quarter, is now expected to be very moderate in the second half of this year. in particular, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global demand, falling consumer and business confidence, and unfavourable effects on financing conditions resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. at the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from continued positive growth in the emerging market economies as well as from the low short-term interest rates and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. downside risks notably relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to further spill over into the euro area real economy. they also relate to the still high energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 3.0% in september 2011, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.5% in august. inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months but to decline thereafter. this pattern reflects the expectation of relatively stable wage growth developments in the context of moderate economic growth.  the governing council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. on the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was 2.8% in august 2011, up from 2.1% in july. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, was 2.8% in august, after 2.6% in july. a number of factors, possibly related to the intensification of tensions in some financial markets, could have had an upward effect on the components of m3. in particular, sizeable inflows into overnight deposits and money market fund shares/units, as well as a substantial inflow into repurchase agreements, appear to have driven monetary developments in august. the inflow into repurchase agreements mainly reflected secured lending in the interbank market, which was increasingly settled via central counterparties that are allocated to the money-holding sector. overall, m3 growth was driven in particular by the increase in the annual growth rate of m1 from 1.0% in july to 1.7% in august and the increase in the annual growth rate of marketable instruments.  on the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations and to households in august, both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained unchanged from july, at 2.2% and 2.7% respectively. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, trends in broad money and loan growth have broadly stabilised over recent months. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion thus remains moderate. the situation of the banking sector calls for particular attention, taking into account the interplay between sovereign risk issues and banks’ funding needs. as we have done on previous occasions, the governing council urges banks to do all that is necessary to reinforce their balance sheets, to retain earnings, to ensure moderation in remuneration, and to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases. where necessary, they should take full advantage of government support measures, which should be made totally operational, including the possibility in future for the european financial stability facility (efsf) to lend to governments in order to recapitalise banks.  to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. inflation has remained elevated and incoming information has confirmed our view that inflation is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead but to decline thereafter. a cross-check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavourable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year. the economic outlook remains subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. at the same time, short-term interest rates remain low. it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. a very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. turning to fiscal policies, with financial market uncertainty remaining high, all governments need to take decisive and frontloaded action to bolster public confidence in the sustainability of government finances. all euro area governments need to show their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature as a key element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. countries under joint eu-imf adjustment programmes as well as those particularly vulnerable to financial market conditions need to unambiguously implement all announced measures for fiscal consolidation and the strengthening of domestic fiscal frameworks, and they need to stand ready to take any additional measures that may become necessary owing to the evolution of their situation.  fiscal consolidation and structural reforms must go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. the governing council therefore urges all euro area governments to decisively and swiftly implement substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. this will help these countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. in this respect, labour market reforms are key, with a focus on the removal of rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility. in particular, we should see the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses and a strengthening of firm-level agreements. more generally, in these demanding times, moderation is of the essence in terms of both profit margins and wages. these measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector, thereby facilitating productivity growth and supporting competitiveness",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide key_interest_rate unchanged inflation remain elevated incoming information confirm view

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110908.en.html,8 September 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead before declining next year. at the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate, while monetary liquidity remains ample. as expected, the pace of economic growth in the euro area decelerated in the second quarter, following strong growth in the first quarter. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. at the same time, short-term interest rates are low. while our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, some financing conditions have tightened. it remains essential for monetary policy to focus on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. a very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments. the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp growth decelerated to 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2011, after 0.8% in the first quarter. as expected, temporary factors which had boosted growth in the early part of the year ceased, and adverse effects resulted from the japanese earthquake and the lagged impact of past oil price increases. looking ahead, a number of developments seem to be dampening the underlying momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global growth, related declines in equity prices and in business confidence, and unfavourable effects resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. as a consequence, real gdp growth is expected to increase very moderately in the second half of this year. at the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from ongoing growth in the global economy as well as from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. this assessment is also reflected in the september 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2011 and between 0.4% and 2.2% in 2012. compared with the june 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for real gdp growth in 2011 and 2012 have been revised downwards. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area are on the downside, in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. downside risks mainly relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy. they also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.5% in august 2011, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from july. we have now seen inflation rates at relatively high levels since the end of last year, with higher energy and other commodity prices as the main drivers. looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. thereafter, on the basis of the path implied by futures markets for oil prices, inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2012. this pattern reflects the expectation of relatively stable wage growth developments in the context of moderate economic growth. the september 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area embody these considerations and foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2012. in comparison with the june 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the range for hicp inflation in 2011 remains unchanged, while the range for 2012 is slightly narrower. it is necessary to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions. the governing council views the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as being broadly balanced. on the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of higher than assumed increases in oil and non-oil commodity prices as well as increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. the main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was 2.0% in july 2011, after 1.9% in june. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector was 2.4% in july, after 2.5% in june. looking beyond the monthly data and the effects of special factors, trends in broad money and loan growth have broadly stabilised over recent months. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. at the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample. looking at m3 components, the annual growth rate of m1 decreased to 0.9% in july, whereas growth in other short-term deposits remained unchanged at 3.7%. these developments continue to partly reflect the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. on the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to edge up slightly, from 1.5% in june to 1.6% in july, whereas the annual growth of loans to households seems to have levelled off at around 3%. the overall size of mfi balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation, in line with the findings of the recent stress tests.  to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead before declining next year. a cross- check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate, while monetary liquidity remains ample. as expected, the pace of economic growth in the euro area decelerated in the second quarter, following strong growth in the first quarter. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. at the same time, short-term interest rates are low. while our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, some financing conditions have tightened. it remains essential for monetary policy to focus on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. a very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments. turning to fiscal policies, a number of governments have announced additional measures to ensure the achievement of their consolidation targets and to strengthen the legal basis for national fiscal rules. to ensure credibility, it is now crucial that the announced measures be frontloaded and implemented in full. governments need to stand ready to implement further consolidation measures, notably on the expenditure side, if risks regarding the attainment of the current fiscal targets materialise. countries that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction. all euro area governments need to demonstrate their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature, which is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. fiscal consolidation and structural reforms must go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. the governing council therefore urges all euro area governments to decisively and swiftly implement substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. this will help these countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. in this respect, labour market reforms are key, with a focus on the removal of rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility. in particular, we should see the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses and a strengthening of firm-level agreements so that wages and working conditions can be tailored to firms’ specific needs. these measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector, thereby facilitating productivity growth and supporting competitiveness",base regular

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110804.en.html,4 August 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point increase on 7 july 2011. the information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. while the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. as expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter. continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. however, uncertainty is particularly high. for monetary policy, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. at the same time, short-term interest rates remain low and financing conditions are favourable. thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability.  given the renewed tensions in some financial markets in the euro area, the governing council today also decided to conduct a liquidity-providing supplementary longer-term refinancing operation (ltro) with a maturity of approximately six months. the operation will be conducted as a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment. the rate in this operation will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations (mros) over the life of the supplementary ltro. the operation will be announced on 9 august 2011, with allotment on 10 august 2011 and settlement on 11 august 2011, and will mature on 1 march 2012. the governing council also decided to continue conducting its mros as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last maintenance period of 2011 on 17 january 2012. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the last quarter of 2011. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. furthermore, the governing council has decided to conduct the three-month ltros to be allotted on 26 october, 30 november and 21 december 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. in the first quarter of 2011 euro area real gdp posted a strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8%. data and survey releases for the second quarter point towards ongoing real gdp growth, albeit, as expected, at a slower pace. this moderation also reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors. the underlying positive momentum of economic growth in the euro area remains in place and continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. in addition, the present level of consumer and business confidence in the euro area supports private sector domestic demand. however, growth dynamics are currently weakened by a number of factors contributing to uncertainty, and activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various regions and sectors. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook for the euro area remain broadly balanced in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. on the one hand, consumer and business confidence, together with improvements in labour market conditions, could continue to provide support to domestic economic activity. on the other hand, downside risks may have intensified. they relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the euro area financial markets as well as to global developments, and the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.5% in july 2011, following 2.7% in june. the relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and other commodity prices. looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and other commodity prices, is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. it remains of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. finally, upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the euro area. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 2.1% in june 2011, from 2.5% in may. looking through the recent monthly volatility, m3 growth has broadly stabilised over recent months, after edging up until the first quarter of 2011. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector declined to 2.5% in june, from 2.7% in may. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. at the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample, and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area.  looking at m3 components, the annual growth rate of m1 remained unchanged at 1.2%, whereas growth in other short-term deposits declined to 3.7%. the growth differentials continue to reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. at the same time, the still relatively steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. however, this impact is likely to be waning. on the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to edge up, from 0.9% in may to 1.5% in june, whereas the annual growth of loans to households hovered over recent months around rates of slightly above 3%.  the overall size of mfi balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. in this respect, we welcome the eu-wide stress-testing exercise, which was prepared by the european banking authority and national supervisors, in close cooperation with the ecb. we also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient.  to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point increase on 7 july 2011. the information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. a cross-check with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. as expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter. continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. however, uncertainty is particularly high. for monetary policy, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. at the same time, short-term interest rates remain low and financing conditions favourable. thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability.  turning to fiscal policies, the governing council stresses the need for strict and timely implementation of the imf/eu adjustment programmes in greece, ireland and portugal. in addition, it underlines the importance of the renewed commitment of all heads of state or government of the euro area to adhere strictly to the agreed fiscal targets. for several countries, this requires announcing and implementing additional and more frontloaded fiscal adjustment measures. those that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction. the common aim should be to put public debt ratios and public finances on a sustainable path as soon as possible. as emphasised by the heads of state or government of the euro area, the inflexible determination of all euro area countries to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  the governing council also welcomes the renewed commitment of all member states to improve competitiveness and address macroeconomic imbalances. indeed, substantial and comprehensive structural reforms need to be implemented in the countries of the euro area in order to increase the flexibility of their economies and their longer-term growth potential. the removal of labour market rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility, notably the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses, are of key importance",base regular economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110707.en.html,7 July 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points, after raising rates by 25 basis points in april 2011 from historically low levels. the further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. the underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover, while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. all in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. at the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity and job creation. as expected, recent economic data indicate some deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of 2011. while the underlying momentum of economic growth in the euro area continues to be positive, uncertainty remains elevated. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability.  the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. in the first quarter of 2011 euro area real gdp posted a strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8%, following the 0.3% increase in the last quarter of 2010. recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year, albeit at a slower pace. this moderation reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors. the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains in place. euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. at the same time, taking into account the present level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute to economic growth. however, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. on the one hand, favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.7% in june 2011 according to eurostat’s flash estimate – the same rate as in may. the relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. it remains of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. finally, upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 2.4% in may 2011, from 2.0% in april. looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors, m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector continued to strengthen slightly, rising to 2.7% in may after 2.6% in april. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has continued its gradual recovery. at the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area.  looking at m3 components, the annual growth rate of m1 moderated further in may, whereas growth in other short-term deposits increased. these developments reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. at the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. however, recent information suggests that this impact may be waning. on the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations and to households remained unchanged from april at 0.9% and 3.4% respectively, confirming the pattern of developments in previous months.  the overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points, after raising rates by 25 basis points in april 2011 from historically low levels. the further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover, while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. all in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. at the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity and job creation. as expected, recent economic data indicate some deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of 2011. while the underlying momentum of economic growth in the euro area continues to be positive, uncertainty remains elevated. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability.  turning to fiscal policies, the current environment is very demanding and requires decisive action. euro area countries must, as a minimum, comply with their fiscal consolidation commitments for 2011 and beyond, as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. adequate and more frontloaded adjustment should ensure that structural fiscal consolidation targets are met, in line with the ecofin council recommendations, and any better than expected economic and fiscal developments should be exploited to achieve faster deficit reduction. the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond is essential to convince the general public and financial market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained and that public debt developments will be put on a sustainable path. at the same time, it remains essential that substantial and comprehensive structural reforms are urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen competitiveness, flexibility and longer-term growth potential. this is particularly relevant for countries with high fiscal and external deficits or with past losses in competitiveness. we welcome the introduction of the european semester, including the recent submission of countries’ national reform programmes that incorporate commitments made under the euro plus pact. we also support the european council conclusions calling for more ambitious and well-defined reforms that should be frontloaded in order to foster competitiveness. in addition, the removal of labour market rigidities would strongly support the adjustment process. measures which enhance wage flexibility, such as the elimination of automatic wage indexation, would help to accomplish the necessary adjustment",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide increase key_interest_rate point raise rate point historically low level adjustment current accommodative monetary_policy

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110609.en.html,9 June 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our meeting on 5 may 2011 confirms continued upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. monetary liquidity remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. furthermore, the most recent data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. overall, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity. on balance, risks to the outlook for price stability are on the upside. accordingly, strong vigilance is warranted. on the basis of our assessment, we will act in a firm and timely manner. we will do all that is needed to prevent recent price developments giving rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. we remain strongly determined to secure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area.  the governing council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (mros) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the ninth maintenance period of 2011 on 11 october 2011. this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the third quarter of 2011. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. furthermore, the governing council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted on 27 july, 31 august and 28 september 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. as stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. in the first quarter of 2011, the euro area recorded strong real gdp growth of 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, following the 0.3% increase of the fourth quarter of 2010. recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year, albeit at a slower pace. this easing reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was partly due to special factors, which will cease to play a role in the second quarter. hence, it is appropriate to look through such short-term volatility and to emphasise the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. at the same time, taking into account the favourable level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth, benefiting from the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. however, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. this assessment is also reflected in the june 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.5% and 2.3 % in 2011 and between 0.6 % and 2.8% in 2012. compared with the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2011 has been revised upwards, while the range for 2012 remains broadly unchanged. the june 2011 eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with recent forecasts by international organisations. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. on the one hand, favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.7% in may according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.8% in april. the relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. it remains of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  the june 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011 and between 1.1% and 2.3% for 2012. in comparison with the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the range for hicp inflation in 2011 has been revised upwards, largely reflecting higher energy prices. the projection range for 2012 has narrowed somewhat. it is appropriate to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions, including oil prices, interest rates and exchange rates. in particular, it is assumed that oil prices will decline somewhat and that short-term interest rates will rise, in accordance with market expectations. overall the projections embody the view that the recent high rates of inflation do not lead to broader-based inflationary pressure in the euro area.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. finally, upside risks may come from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was 2.0% in april 2011, after 2.3% in march. looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth, m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector strengthened slightly to 2.6% in april, after 2.5% in march. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. at the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area.  looking at m3 components, the annual growth rate of m1 decreased in april, while that of other short-term deposits increased. the development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months. at the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. however, available information suggests that this impact may be waning. on the counterpart side, there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 1.0% in april, after 0.8% in march. the growth of loans to households was 3.4% in april, unchanged from the previous month. the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. the overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months, notwithstanding some volatility. it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our meeting on 5 may 2011 confirms

expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area.  turning to fiscal policies, all parties involved in the preparation of the 2012 national budgets must ensure that they are fully in line with the requirement to support confidence in fiscal policies. a comparison between the latest economic forecasts by the european commission and the fiscal plans embodied in the stability programmes points to the need for many countries to underpin their budget targets with concrete consolidation measures in order to correct their excessive deficits by the commonly agreed deadlines. the implementation of credible fiscal adjustment strategies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures.  at the same time, the implementation of ambitious and far-reaching structural reforms is urgently required in the euro area to strengthen substantially its competitiveness, flexibility and longer-term growth potential. in particular, countries which have high fiscal and external deficits or which are suffering from a loss of competitiveness should rapidly carry out comprehensive economic reforms. in the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should be vigorously pursued to facilitate productivity growth. regarding the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110505.en.html,5 May 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged following the 25-basis point increase on 7 april 2011. the information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. we continue to see upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. while the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. furthermore, recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, with uncertainty continuing to be elevated. all in all, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. with interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance still accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgements and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy. as stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area during the first quarter of 2011 and at the beginning of the second quarter. looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. at the same time, taking into account the high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth, benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. however, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, particularly in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions in north africa and the middle east, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. finally, there are still potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the natural and nuclear disasters in japan. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.8% in april according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.7% in march. the increase in inflation rates during the first four months of 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. it is of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices, not least on account of the ongoing political tensions in north africa and the middle east. more generally, strong economic growth in emerging markets, supported by ample liquidity at the global level, may further fuel commodity price rises. moreover, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 2.3% in march 2011, from 2.1% in february. looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth caused by special factors, m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained broadly unchanged at 2.5% in march, after 2.6% in february. overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up, but it remains moderate. at the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area.  looking at m3 components, the annual growth rate of m1 remained broadly unchanged in march, while that of other short-term deposits increased. the development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months. at the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. on the counterpart side, there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.8% in march, after 0.6% in february. the growth of loans to households was 3.4% in march, compared with 3.0% in february. looking through short-term volatility, the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. the overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months, notwithstanding some volatility. it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. to sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged following the 25-basis point increase on 7 april 2011. the information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. we continue to see upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. a cross-check with the signals coming from our monetary analysis indicates that, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. furthermore, recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, with uncertainty continuing to be elevated. all in all, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. with interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance still accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgements and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy. turning to fiscal policies, current information points to uneven developments in countries’ adherence to the agreed fiscal consolidation plans. there is a risk that, in some countries, fiscal balances may fall behind the targets agreed by the ecofin council for the necessary and timely correction of excessive deficits. it is essential that all governments meet the fiscal balance targets for 2011 that they have announced. where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. the implementation of credible policies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures.  at the same time, it is of the utmost importance that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be implemented urgently in the euro area in order to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. in particular, countries which have high fiscal and external deficits or which are suffering from a loss of competitiveness should embark on comprehensive economic reforms. in the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to bring about improvements in productivity. regarding the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. the governing council, in line with the ecb’s opinion of 17 february 2011 on the six legislative proposals on economic governance, urges the ecofin council, the european parliament and the european commission to agree, in the context of their “trialogue”, on more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness. finally, the governing council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was agreed by the portuguese government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the european commission, in liaison with the ecb, and the international monetary fund. the programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the portuguese economy. it addresses in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns and will thereby contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area. the governing council welcomes the commitment of the portuguese public authorities to take all the necessary measures to achieve the objectives of the programme. it considers very important the broad political support for the adjustment programme, which enhances the overall credibility of the programme",base regular economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110407.en.html,7 April 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points, after maintaining them unchanged for almost two years at historically low levels. the adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis. while our monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. all in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. at the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation. recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability.  as stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area in early 2011. looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy. at the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to economic growth, benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. moreover, continued strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, in particular in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. finally, there are potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the recent natural and nuclear disaster in japan. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.6% in march 2011, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.4 % in february. the increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. it is of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not lead to second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and thereby give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices, not least owing to ongoing political tensions in north africa and the middle east. more generally, strong economic growth in emerging markets, supported by ample liquidity at the global level, may further fuel commodity price rises. moreover, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 2.0% in february 2011, from 1.5% in january. looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors, m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased further to 2.6% in february, from 2.4% in the previous month. hence, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up, but remains moderate. at the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area.  looking at m3 components, annual m1 growth moderated further to 2.9% in february 2011, while the growth of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments has increased. this rebalancing within m3 reflects the impact of the recent steepening of the yield curve on the remuneration of different monetary assets. however, this steeper yield curve also implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. on the counterpart side, a further rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in february is due in part to a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.6% in february, after 0.5% in january. the growth of loans to households was 3.0% in february, compared with 3.1% in january. overall, in early 2011 the positive flow of lending to the non-financial private sector has become more broadly based across the household and non-financial corporation sectors. the latest data confirm that banks have expanded their lending to the private sector further, while at the same time the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged. it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. to sum up, the governing council decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. the adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis. a cross-check with the signals from our monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. all in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. at the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation. recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability.  turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that all governments achieve the consolidation targets for 2011 that they have announced. moreover, the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond would help to convince the general public and market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained. strengthened confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth.  at the same time, it is crucial that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. in the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to facilitate advances in productivity. on the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. finally, the governing council is of the view that the package of six legislative proposals on economic governance, adopted by the european council at its summit on 24-25 march 2011, goes some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. however, in our view, the proposals fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union. therefore, the governing council, in line with the ecb’s opinion of 17 february 2011 on these proposals, urges the ecofin council, the european parliament and the commission to agree, in the context of their “trialogue”, on more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness. all this would help to ensure that the new framework is effective in the long run",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide increase

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110303.en.html,3 March 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information which has become available since our meeting on 3 february 2011 indicates a rise in inflation, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. the economic analysis indicates that risks to the outlook for price developments are on the upside, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains positive; however, uncertainty remains elevated. the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. it is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability. overall, the governing council remains prepared to act in a firm and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence.  the governing council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (mros) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2011 on 12 july 2011. furthermore, the governing council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted on 27 april, 25 may and 29 june 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. as we have stated before, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real gdp in both the third and the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area at the beginning of 2011. looking ahead, euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy. at the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, benefiting from the very accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. this assessment is also reflected in the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.3% and 2.1% in 2011 and between 0.8% and 2.8% in 2012. compared with the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the lower ends of these ranges have been shifted upwards, reflecting better prospects for the global economy – and thus for euro area exports – as well as for domestic demand. the march 2011 ecb staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are broadly balanced in a context of elevated uncertainty. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices, in particular in view of renewed geopolitical tensions, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.4% in february 2011, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.3% in january. the increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. it is paramount that the rise in hicp inflation does not lead to second-round effects and thereby give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 2.0% and 2.6% for 2011 and between 1.0% and 2.4% for 2012. in comparison with the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for hicp inflation have been shifted upwards. this is mainly due to the considerable rise in energy and food prices. it should be stressed that the projections are based on commodity price futures as of mid-february 2011, and therefore do not take into account the most recent oil price increases. moreover, it needs to be emphasised that the projections assume continued moderate domestic wage and price-setting behaviour. risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are on the upside. they relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy and non-energy commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. price and wage setters’ behaviour should not lead to broadly based second-round effects stemming from higher commodity prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 declined to 1.5% in january 2011, from 1.7% in december 2010, while the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 2.4% in january, from 1.9% in december. looking beyond the movements in individual months and the effects of special factors, trends in broad money and loan growth confirm the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to longer term should remain contained. at the same time, the low level of money and credit growth has thus far led to only a partial unwinding of the large amounts of monetary liquidity accumulated in the economy prior to the period of financial tensions. this liquidity may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures currently emerging in commodity markets as a result of strong economic growth and ample liquidity at the global level. looking at m3 components, annual m1 growth moderated further to stand at 3.2% in january 2011, reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits. at the same time, the yield curve steepened somewhat further at the start of the year, implying that the attractiveness of short-term instruments included in m3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. on the counterpart side, the rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in january was due to stronger lending to both households and non-financial corporations. the growth of loans to non-financial corporations turned positive, to stand at 0.4% in january, after -0.2% in december, while the growth of loans to households strengthened further to 3.1%, from 2.9% in december. overall, lending to the non-financial private sector has gradually strengthened over the past few quarters, as the economic recovery gathered momentum. the latest data also confirm that banks have continued to expand their lending to the euro area economy, while at the same time keeping the overall size of their balance sheets broadly unchanged. it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, in an environment of increasing demand. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. to sum up, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information which has become available since our meeting on 3 february 2011 indicates a rise in inflation, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. the economic analysis indicates that risks to the outlook for price developments are on the upside, while the cross-check with the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains positive; however, uncertainty remains elevated. the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. it is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability. overall, the governing council remains prepared to act in a firm and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. turning to fiscal policies, all governments need to fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans in 2011. where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. beyond 2011, countries need to specify ambitious and concrete policy measures in their multi-year adjustment programmes, so as to underpin the credibility of their fiscal consolidation targets of ensuring a rapid correction of excessive deficits and returning to a close-to-balance or surplus position. strengthening confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth.  at the same time, it is crucial that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. in the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued. on the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. the current sovereign debt crisis in the euro area has reinforced the need for an ambitious reform of the economic governance framework of the euro area. the governing council of the ecb is of the view that the legislative proposals which have been put forward by the european commission go some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. however, they fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union. as outlined in the ecb’s opinion of 17 february 2011 on these proposals, more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness are required to ensure that the new framework will indeed be effective in the long run",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available indicate rise

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110203.en.html,3 February 2011,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council confirmed that the current key ecb interest rates still remain appropriate. it therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 13 january 2011, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. our monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence.  overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, and the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. the stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real gdp in the third quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence for the fourth quarter and the beginning of the year continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. looking ahead, euro area exports should benefit from the ongoing recovery in the world economy. at the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, while uncertainty remains elevated. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.4% in january 2011, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.2% in december. this further increase was broadly anticipated and largely reflects higher energy prices. looking ahead to the next few months, inflation rates could temporarily increase further and are likely to stay slightly above 2% for most of 2011, before moderating again around the turn of the year. overall, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. such pressure is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. these developments have not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but, as already indicated in january, could move to the upside. currently, upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and price pressures in the production chain could rise further. on the downside, risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth, given the prevailing uncertainties.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 declined to 1.7% in december 2010, from 2.1% in november. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also declined, albeit marginally, to 1.9% in december, after 2.0% in november. these declines partly reflect the reversal of special factors that operated in november and do not indicate a general weakening of monetary dynamics. overall, however, broad money and loan growth is still low, confirming the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. looking at m3 components, annual m1 growth moderated further to stand at 4.4% in december 2010, reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits. at the same time, the yield curve has steepened somewhat further, implying that the attractiveness of short-term instruments included in m3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside m3. on the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to conceal differences in the magnitude of growth across sectors. the growth of loans to non-financial corporations stood at -0.2% in december, after -0.1% in the previous month, while the growth of loans to households strengthened to 3.0% in december, after 2.8% in november. taking into account the effect of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets and looking through short-term volatility, the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. at the same time, the latest data point to the overall size of bank balance sheets having contracted again after expanding for most of 2010, mainly on account of a reduction in lending between banks. it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, in an environment of increasing demand. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates still remain appropriate. we therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 13 january 2011, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. a cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence.  turning to fiscal policies, it is now essential that all governments fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans in 2011. where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. beyond 2011, countries need to specify concrete policy measures in their multi-year adjustment programmes so as to underpin the credibility of their fiscal consolidation targets. experience shows that expenditure restraint is an important step towards achieving and maintaining fiscal soundness, notably when enshrined in binding domestic policy rules. such a commitment helps to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances, reduces interest rate risk premia and improves the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. the implementation of credible policies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures.  substantial and far-reaching structural reforms, complementing fiscal adjustment, should be urgently implemented to improve the prospects for higher sustainable growth and employment. major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. increased product market competition and labour market flexibility would further support the necessary adjustment processes in the economy. all these structural reforms should be supported by the necessary improvements in the structure of the banking sector. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern confirm current key_interest_rate remain appropriate decide

correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 2.2% in december, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.9% in november. this was somewhat higher than expected and largely reflects higher energy prices. looking ahead to the next few months, inflation rates could temporarily increase further. they are likely to stay slightly above 2%, largely owing to commodity price developments, before moderating again towards the end of the year. overall, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, stemming largely from global commodity prices. while this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, very close monitoring of price developments is warranted. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but could move to the upside. upside risks relate, in particular, to

consolidation in the coming years, and price pressures in the production chain could rise further. on the downside, risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth, given the prevailing uncertainties.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 1.9% in november 2010, after 0.9% in october. this strong increase is in part related to base effects and volatile factors. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased, rising to 2.0% in november from 1.5% in october. looking beyond the special factors that operated in november, broad money and loan growth is still low, corroborating the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. the interest rate constellation continued to exert a significant impact on the growth of monetary aggregates. looking at m3 components, the interest rates paid on short-term time deposits remained higher than those paid on overnight deposits. as a result, annual m1 growth continued to moderate, standing at 4.6% in november 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits continued to become less negative. at the same time, the yield curve has lately become steeper again, implying that the attractiveness of short-term deposits included in m3 has declined somewhat compared with more highly remunerated longer-term assets outside m3. the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to increase in november, partly owing to special factors. at the sectoral level, this strengthening increasingly reflects the upward movement in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which stood at -0.1% in november, after -0.5% in october, thereby further confirming that a turning point was reached in the course of 2010. the growth of loans to households remained stronger, at 2.7% in november after 2.9% in october, but the latest data point to some signs of a levelling-off. over the past few months banks have expanded the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment in which the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly stable. the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates still remain appropriate. we therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2

anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence.  turning to fiscal policies, in view of the ongoing vulnerability to adverse market reactions, countries need to do their utmost to meet their deficit targets and put government debt-to-gdp ratios firmly on a downward trajectory. in this regard, the governing council takes note of the recently announced measures in some euro area countries to reduce their very large fiscal imbalances. where necessary, additional corrective measures – preferably on the expenditure side – need to be swiftly defined and implemented. at the same time, all euro area countries should pursue ambitious and credible multi-year consolidation strategies. this will help to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected economic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation.  substantial and far-reaching structural reforms, complementing fiscal adjustment, should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. the removal of labour market rigidities would further support the adjustment process of these economies. increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation. such measures are crucial for enhancing productivity growth, which is one of the main drivers of long-term growth. all these structural reforms should be supported by the necessary improvements in the structure of the banking sector. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks’ resilience to

interest rates are appropriate. it therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 4 november 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of the recovery, while

firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence.  the governing council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (mros) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the third maintenance period of 2011 on 12 april 2011.  furthermore, the governing council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros) to be allotted on 26 january, 23 february and 30 march 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. the stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp grew by 0.4% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter of 2010, following exceptional growth of 1.0% in the second quarter. recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence generally confirm that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place. in line with previous expectations, this implies ongoing real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of this year. euro area exports should further benefit from a continued recovery in the world economy. at the same time, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. this assessment is also reflected in the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real gdp growth will range between 1.6% and 1.8% in 2010, between 0.7% and 2.1%% in 2011 and between 0.6% and 2.8% in 2012. compared with the september 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2010 has narrowed somewhat and shifted towards the upper end of september’s range, while the range for 2011 is slightly narrower. the december 2010 eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining elevated. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. at the same time, it is to be noted that the level of business confidence in the euro area remains relatively high. on the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.9% in november, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from october. in the next few months hicp inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. overall, in the period ahead inflation rates should remain moderate. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this assessment is also reflected in the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010, between 1.3% and 2.3% for 2011 and between 0.7% and 2.3% for 2012. compared with the ecb staff projections published in september, the range for 2010 is unchanged, while the range for 2011 is marginally higher. available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture.  risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 remained broadly unchanged at 1.0% in october, after 1.1% in september 2010. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 1.4% in october from 1.2% in the previous month. broad money and loan growth hence remained low, supporting the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. the steepness of the yield curve has continued to lessen somewhat, implying a gradual softening of the dampening impact on m3 that was associated with shifts of funds from monetary assets to longer-term financial assets outside m3. the interest rate constellation also includes a further widening in the spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits. as a result, annual m1 growth has continued to moderate, standing at 4.9% in october 2010, after 6.2% in september, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits continues to become less negative. the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households, with 2.9% in october after 2.8% in september, and still negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations, which stood at -0.6% in october, unchanged from september. when correcting for the impact of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets, the growth in loans to non-financial corporations continued to strengthen, further confirming that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010. over the past few months, banks have generally stabilised the size of their balance sheets while expanding the provision of credit to the private sector. however, the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. to address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. we therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 4 november 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of the recovery, while uncertainty is elevated. a cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. turning to fiscal policies, while budgetary developments for some euro area countries are more favourable than expected, concerns about unsustainable fiscal positions and their vulnerability to adverse market reactions remain very high for others and have had repercussions throughout the euro area. in this environment, there is a clear need for the responsible authorities to strengthen confidence in sound public finances, thereby reducing risk premia in interest rates and supporting sustainable growth over the medium term. at the same time, all euro area countries should pursue ambitious and credible multi-year consolidation strategies and implement fully the planned corrective measures, focusing on the expenditure side. in their 2011 budgets, countries need to specify the necessary fiscal adjustment measures in detail, while standing ready to correct any slippages from the fiscal objectives announced.  substantial and far-reaching structural reforms should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. the removal of labour market rigidities would further support the adjustment process of these economies. increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. such measures are crucial for enhancing productivity growth, one of the main drivers of long-term growth. all these structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. finally, let me recall that the governing council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was agreed by the irish government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the european commission, in liaison with the ecb, and the international monetary fund. the programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the irish economy. it addresses in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns and will thereby contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area. the governing council welcomes the commitment of the irish public authorities to take any further measures that may become appropriate to achieve the objectives of the programme",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern confirm current

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is101104.en.html,4 November 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council continues to view the current key ecb interest rates as appropriate. it therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 7 october 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. recent economic data are consistent with our assessment that the underlying momentum of the recovery remains positive. at the same time, uncertainty is prevailing. our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. the stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. recent data releases and survey evidence generally confirm our view that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place. in line with previous expectations, this implies ongoing real gdp growth in the second half of this year. the global recovery is expected to proceed, and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports. at the same time, private sector domestic demand should contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty prevailing. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. on the other hand, some concerns remain relating to the re-emergence of tensions in financial markets. in addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures, and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, as anticipated, euro area annual hicp inflation rose to 1.9% in october, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.8% in september. in the next few months hicp inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. overall, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. they relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was broadly unchanged, at 1.0% in september 2010, after 1.1% in august. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, at 1.2%, remained unchanged from august. looking beyond developments in individual months, broad money and loan growth remains low and continues to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. the annual growth rate of m1 has continued to moderate, standing at 5.9% in september 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. this reflects the widening spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits.  the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector is increasingly supported by the flow of loans to non-financial corporations. the annual growth rate of these loans is still slightly negative, but developments in recent months suggest that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010. this would be consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles. the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.8% in september and thereby remained at levels seen in previous months.  banks have continued to gradually increase the weight of credit to the private sector in the overall size of their balance sheets, but the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. we therefore decided to leave them unchanged. taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 7 october 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term

outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  turning to fiscal policies, there is a clear need to strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. to this end, it is essential that countries pursue credible multi-year consolidation plans and fully implement the planned consolidation measures. in their 2011 budgets, they need to specify credible fiscal adjustment measures, focusing on the expenditure side. any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation.  the urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. the removal of labour market rigidities and the strengthening of productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies.  at their meeting on 28-29 october 2010 the eu heads of state and government agreed on the  reform of the european union’s economic governance. the proposals put forward by president van rompuy represent a strengthening of the existing framework for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the european union. however, the governing council considers that they do not go as far as the quantum leap in the economic governance of monetary union that it has been calling for. in particular, the governing council is concerned that there would be insufficient automaticity in the implementation of fiscal surveillance, that there is no specification of the rule to reduce the government debt ratio, and that financial sanctions have not been explicitly retained under the macroeconomic surveillance procedure. with regard to the macroeconomic surveillance procedure in particular, the new system of mutual surveillance would need to concentrate firmly on euro area countries experiencing sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits. it should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms. it would be essential that the assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process.  the public and the markets can be confident that the governing council remains firmly committed to delivering on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term",base regular economic

interest rates as appropriate. it therefore decided to leave them unchanged. considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 september 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. recent economic data are consistent with our expectation that the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace in the second half of this year, with the underlying momentum remaining positive. at the same time, uncertainty is still prevailing. our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. the stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area real gdp grew strongly on a quarterly basis, increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010, supported mainly by domestic demand, but partly reflecting temporary factors. recent statistical releases and survey evidence generally confirm our expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year in the euro area and elsewhere. nevertheless, the positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area remains in place. the global recovery is expected to go on, and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports. at the same time, private sector domestic demand should gradually strengthen further, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty still prevailing. on the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. on the other hand, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets. in addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.8% in september, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.6% in august. the increase in inflation was anticipated and reflects base effects mainly stemming from the energy component. in the next few months hicp inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. overall, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. they relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 rose to 1.1% in august 2010, from 0.2% in july. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also rose, standing at 1.2%, after 0.8% in the previous month. in both cases, the rise reflects relatively strong monthly flows. the still low growth rates continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. the yield curve has remained fairly steep, but the downward impact of this on monetary growth is gradually waning. moreover, while spreads between different short-term interest rates are still generally narrow, they have been widening somewhat between rates paid on short-term time deposits and overnight deposits. as a result, the annual growth rate of m1 has continued to moderate from high levels, and stood at 7.7% in august 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative.  the rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector reflects both a further slight increase in the positive growth of loans to households and a gradually less negative annual growth rate in loans to non-financial corporations. the latest developments are consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles.  banks have gradually increased the overall size of their balance sheets recently, but the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up further. where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. we therefore decided to leave them unchanged. considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 september 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain

of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  turning to fiscal policies, we take note of the recent announcements made in some euro area countries with regard to measures to tackle the existing fiscal imbalances. indeed, a number of countries have to meet major challenges, and immediate, ambitious and convincing corrective action is required. credible multi-year consolidation plans are needed and will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. for all euro area countries, the 2011 budgets need to reflect the commitment to ambitious fiscal consolidation in line with countries’ pledges under the excessive deficit procedures. any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation.  the urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. the removal of labour market rigidities and the strengthening of productivity growth would further

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100902.en.html,2 September 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council continues to view the current key ecb interest rates as appropriate. it therefore decided to leave them unchanged. considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 5 august 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected, partly owing to temporary factors. looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace, with uncertainty still prevailing. our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  the governing council has today also decided to continue to conduct its main refinancing operations (mros) and its special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of this year’s twelfth maintenance period on 18 january 2011. the fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time. furthermore, it has decided to conduct the 3-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros), to be carried out in october, november and december 2010, as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rates in these 3-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro. the governing council has also decided to carry out three additional fine-tuning operations on 30 september, 11 november and 23 december when 6-month and 12-month refinancing operations mature. overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. this is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the securities markets programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. we remain firmly committed to maintaining price stability over the medium to longer term. the monetary policy stance, the overall provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. after a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. euro area real gdp grew strongly on a quarterly basis, increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010, supported by ongoing growth at the global level but also in part reflecting temporary domestic factors. recent data and survey evidence generally confirm the expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year, both at the global level and in the euro area. nevertheless, while uncertainty still prevails, they continue to indicate a positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area. ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should continue to support the euro area economy. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects.  this assessment is also reflected in the september 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real gdp growth will range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.3% in 2011. compared with the june 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the range for real gdp growth this year has been revised upwards, owing to the stronger than expected rebound in economic growth in the second quarter as well as better than expected developments over the summer months. for 2011 the range has also been revised upwards, reflecting mainly carry-over effects from the projected stronger growth towards the end of 2010.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to this improved economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty still prevailing. on the one hand, global trade may continue to perform more strongly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. on the other hand, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets and to some uncertainty about growth prospects in other advanced economies and at the global level. in addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.6% in august, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.7% in july. the small decline in inflation is likely to reflect base effects in the energy component. later in the year annual hicp inflation rates are expected to increase slightly while displaying some volatility. looking further ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  this assessment is also reflected in the september 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2011. compared with the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections of june 2010, the ranges have been revised slightly upwards, largely on account of higher commodity prices.  risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. they relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 stood at 0.2% in july 2010, unchanged from june. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, which has been gradually increasing, rose further to 0.9%, but still remains relatively weak. the subdued developments in money and loan growth continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. the downward impact of the steep yield curve on monetary growth, which is reflected in the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside m3, is gradually waning. moreover, the impact of the narrow spreads between different short-term interest rates on the growth of the components of m3 is continuing to diminish. as a result, the annual growth rate of m1 has continued to moderate from high levels, and stood at 8.1% in july 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative.  the still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households and diminishing negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations. these developments are consistent with a normal, lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle.  given the subdued developments in banks’ overall balance sheets, the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 5 august 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected, partly owing to temporary factors. looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace, with uncertainty still prevailing. a cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  turning to fiscal policies, current developments at the euro area aggregate level appear to be broadly in line with previous expectations. at the country level, any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected macroeconomic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. at the same time, in countries where there is still a need to take additional specific measures to achieve consolidation targets, such measures should be adopted swiftly to ensure that consolidation commitments are fulfilled. this is a prerequisite for maintaining confidence in the credibility of governments’ fiscal targets. positive effects on confidence can compensate for the reduction in demand stemming from fiscal consolidation, when fiscal adjustment strategies are perceived as credible, ambitious and focused on the expenditure side. the conditions for such positive effects are particularly favourable in the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty. in order to support the process of fiscal consolidation, to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly and appropriately to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern continue view current key_interest_rate appropriate decide leave unchanged consider new information analysis available continue expect price

developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. the available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010, and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. looking further ahead, and taking into account a number of temporary factors, we continue to expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of uncertainty. our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power

has been expanding since mid-2009. euro area real gdp increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010. the available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010 and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. looking further ahead, and taking into account temporary effects, the governing council continues to expect real gdp to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should continue to support the euro area economy. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced in an environment of uncertainty. on the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than is now projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. on the downside, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1.7% in july, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, from 1.4% in june, most likely owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components. in the next few months annual hicp inflation rates are expected to display some further volatility around the current level. looking further ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. overall, the governing council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 turned positive and was 0.2% in june 2010, after -0.1% in may. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but, at 0.3%, remained weak. together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. shorter-term developments in m3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile, and this volatility may well persist. the previously strong impact of the interest rate constellation on monetary dynamics, while still affecting the pace of underlying money growth, appears to be gradually waning. this implies a gradual reduction in the effect on actual m3 growth arising from the downward impact of the steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside m3. at the same time, the annual growth rate of m1 has continued to moderate, although it remained strong at 9.2% in june 2010. in part, this reflects somewhat higher opportunity costs of holding overnight deposits relative to other short-term deposits.  the still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments, with increasingly positive growth in loans to households and stabilised negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations. a lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle.  the data up to june indicate that, after expanding for a few months earlier in the year, the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has not increased further. the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  in this respect, we welcome the eu-wide stress-testing exercise, which was prepared and conducted by the committee of european banking supervisors (cebs) and national supervisory authorities, in close cooperation with the ecb. this stress-testing exercise was comprehensive and rigorous, and the results confirm the resilience of eu and euro area banking systems as a whole to severe economic and financial shocks. the stress test has also significantly enhanced transparency regarding the current financial conditions and risk exposures of the 91 institutions that participated in the exercise. hence, the exercise represents an important step forward in restoring market confidence. we also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. considering all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 8 july 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. the available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010, and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. looking further ahead, and taking into account a number of temporary factors, we continue to expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of uncertainty. a cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that budget plans for 2011 and beyond reflect a strong commitment to returning to sound public finances. given the exceptional fiscal deterioration over the past two years, there is an urgent need to implement credible medium-term consolidation strategies aimed at restoring fiscal sustainability and creating room for budgetary manoeuvre. as a minimum, countries’ budgetary targets must comply with the fiscal consolidation requirements foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. more ambitious targets, as already adopted by a number of euro area countries, may become necessary where current plans fall short of meeting the main objective of halting and reversing the increase in the government debt ratio. moreover, all countries must specify credible fiscal adjustment measures, focusing on the expenditure side, while being prepared to implement additional measures, where needed, over the coming years. in order to support the process of fiscal consolidation, to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and

council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. after a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. euro area real gdp increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010, according to eurostat’s second estimate. the latest economic data and survey-based indicators suggest that a strengthening in economic activity took place during the spring. the governing council expects real gdp to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. the ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should provide support to the euro area economy. however, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects.  in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, in an environment of high uncertainty. on the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. on the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in financial markets, with possible further adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence. in addition, a stronger or more protracted than previously expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.4% in june, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.6% in may. in the next few months annual hicp inflation rates are expected to display some further volatility, with a tendency towards somewhat higher rates later in the year. looking ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should overall remain moderate, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. overall, the governing council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was unchanged at -0.2% in may 2010. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but, at 0.2%, remained weak. together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. shorter-term developments in m3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile and, given the continued tensions in some financial market segments, this volatility may well persist. the previously strong impact of the interest rate constellation on monetary dynamics appears to be gradually waning. this implies that actual m3 growth is less affected than before by the downward impact of the steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside m3. moreover, the impact that the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments have on shifts within m3 towards m1 should be diminishing. however, at 10.3%, annual m1 growth is still very strong.  the still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments, with positive growth in loans to households and negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations. while the monthly flow in bank loans to non-financial corporations was positive in may, in the light of the volatility observed in recent months it is too early to judge whether this signals a turning point. a lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle.  the data up to may confirm that the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has increased since the turn of the year. the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. in this respect, we welcome the decision announced by the european council to publish, with the consent of the banks involved, the individual results of the stress test exercise for banks in the european union carried out by the committee of european banking supervisors (cebs) in cooperation with the ecb. appropriate action will have to be taken where needed. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 10 june 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of high uncertainty. a cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  as regards fiscal policies, the focus clearly needs to be on ensuring the sustainability of public finances. in the current environment, all euro area countries must, as a minimum, comply with their fiscal consolidation plans as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. more ambitious targets, as already adopted by a number of countries, may become necessary where current plans fall short of meeting the main objective of halting and reversing the increase in the government debt ratio. moreover, all countries must specify credible adjustment measures that are sufficient to attain their budgetary targets for 2010, 2011 and beyond, and must live up to their commitment to take additional measures, where needed, over the coming years. for the proper functioning of the euro area, and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. this will also support the process of fiscal consolidation. major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies.  let me finally refer to the proposals submitted by the governing council to the task force on economic governance established by the european council under the chairmanship of president van rompuy. in the view of the governing council, a quantum leap in terms of progress towards strengthening the institutional foundations of emu is needed. it is essential that governance and enforcement structures in the economic policy framework of the euro area be strengthened. reinforcing surveillance of national budgetary policies and ensuring rigorous compliance with the fiscal rules will be key. furthermore, it is extremely important that close oversight of relative competitiveness developments be implemented and that a surveillance mechanism be established to address imbalances in the euro area countries. at the same time, it is important to establish an appropriate euro area crisis management framework that

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100610.en.html,10 June 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 6 may 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. global inflationary pressures may persist, while domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010, but quarterly growth rates are likely to be rather uneven. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace, in an environment of continued tensions in some financial market segments and of unusually high uncertainty. our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence.  monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. this is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. all the non-standard measures taken during the period of strong financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the securities markets programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. we remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term, and the monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. after a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. according to eurostat’s first estimate, euro area real gdp increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010. while adverse weather conditions, in particular, dampened growth in the early part of the year, the latest economic indicators suggest that a rebound took place during the spring. looking ahead, the governing council expects real gdp to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. the ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should provide support to the euro area economy. however, the recovery of activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and weak labour market prospects.  this assessment is also reflected in the june 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real gdp growth will range between 0.7% and 1.3% in 2010 and between 0.2% and 2.2% in 2011. compared with the march 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the range for real gdp growth this year has been revised slightly upwards, owing to the positive impact of stronger activity worldwide in the short run, while the range has been revised somewhat downwards for 2011, reflecting mainly domestic demand prospects. the june 2010 eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. in the governing council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, in an environment of unusually high uncertainty. on the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. on the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments and related confidence effects. in addition, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.6% in may 2010, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.5% in april. the rise in inflation over recent months mostly reflects higher energy prices. during the second half of this year some further slight increases in hicp inflation cannot be excluded. looking further ahead, inflation rates should overall remain moderate. upward pressures on commodity prices may persist, while euro area domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  this assessment is also reflected in the june 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 1.4% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 1.0% and 2.2% for 2011. compared with the ecb staff projections of march 2010, the ranges have been adjusted somewhat upwards, mainly reflecting higher euro prices for commodities. available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. overall, the governing council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was unchanged at -0.1% in april 2010. the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased somewhat further and turned positive, but remained weak at 0.1%. together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. shorter-term developments in m3 and loans have remained volatile and, given the renewed tensions in some financial market segments, volatility in m3 and its components may well continue. the actual growth in m3 continues to understate the underlying pace of monetary expansion, but the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds to longer-term deposits and securities outside m3 appear to be gradually waning. the same holds for the shifts within m3 that have been observed as a response to the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments. at 10.7%, annual m1 growth is still very strong.  the still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector conceals the fact that monthly flows have now been positive for a number of months. at the same time, these aggregate developments continue to reflect mainly an ongoing strengthening in the annual growth of loans to households, while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained negative. a lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. the latest data confirm that the reduction in the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year. however, further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. to address this challenge, banks should turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 6 may 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. global inflationary pressures may persist, while domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010, but quarterly growth rates are likely to be rather uneven. looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace, in an environment of continued tensions in some financial market segments and of unusually high uncertainty. a cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  as regards fiscal policies, the governing council welcomes the recent decision by euro area countries to formally establish a european financial stability facility. this needs to be accompanied by decisive action at the level of governments. it is essential that all countries stick to their commitments to correct high budget deficits and government debt and reduce fiscal vulnerability. to this end, the concrete adjustment measures needed to achieve the budgetary targets should be fully specified. all countries must ensure that confidence in the sustainability of public finances is guaranteed. the governing council welcomes the fact that a number of euro area governments with the highest deficits and strongly increasing debt levels have adopted additional fiscal consolidation measures and set out more ambitious fiscal targets. in this context, we took note of the spring 2010 orientations for fiscal policies in euro area countries agreed by the euro area finance ministers on 7 june, and welcome the commitment to take additional measures, where needed, in order to ensure the achievement of the budgetary targets for 2010 and beyond. it is indeed key that the new budgetary targets be achieved. the governing council fully agrees with the ministers on the priority of halting and reversing the increase in the debt ratio and welcomes the commitment to take immediate action to that effect.  for all euro area countries, structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery. existing competitiveness problems, as well as domestic and external imbalances, need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned. to that end, wage-bargaining should allow wages to adjust appropriately to the competitiveness and unemployment situation. likewise, measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential. finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100506.en.html,6 May 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all new information since our meeting on 8 april 2010, we expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. global inflationary pressures – driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world – are still being counteracted by low domestic price pressures. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. we expect the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, but growth patterns could be uneven in an environment of high uncertainty. our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. monetary policy will do all that is necessary to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009, after a period of sharp decline. notably, the economy has benefited from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system. recent economic data – including positive survey indicators – support the view that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing in 2010. while adverse weather conditions, in particular, dampened growth in the early part of the year, some strengthening appears to be taking place during the spring. looking ahead, the governing council expects real gdp to expand at a moderate pace. the ongoing recovery at the global level, and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, should provide support to the euro area economy. at the same time, the financial crisis is expected to have a dampening effect on economic growth given the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation of low capacity utilisation and weak labour market prospects.  the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment of high uncertainty. on the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected, with the result that the recovery becomes self-sustained. on the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments. in addition, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and the intensification of protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.5% in april 2010, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.4% in march. this is somewhat higher than expected a few months ago and appears to be related, in particular, to upward pressure in energy prices. looking ahead, global inflationary pressures may increase, driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world, while euro area domestic price pressures are still expected to remain contained. as a result, overall inflation rates are expected to be moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.   in the near term, given the developments in energy prices, risks to earlier projections for hicp inflation are tilted somewhat towards the upside, while risks to price stability over the medium term are viewed as still remaining broadly balanced. upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. at the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. overall, we need to monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 remained slightly negative, at -0.1%, in march 2010. together with the continued negative annual growth in loans to the private sector – -0.2% in march – the latest data further support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that the inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. shorter-term developments in m3 and loans have also remained muted. the actual growth in m3 is seen as weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, as the rather steep yield curve continues to foster the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside m3. at the same time, the still narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of allocating funds to overnight deposits rather than other m3 instruments. this is reflected in the continued marked difference between weak annual growth in m3 and strong annual growth in m1, which was 10.9% in march. however, with the current interest rate constellation already in place for some time, the latest data suggest that the large shifts in the allocations of funds are waning. the annual growth of bank loans to the private sector remained negative in march, but this conceals a further positive monthly flow. it also conceals ongoing opposite developments at the sectoral level, with positive, increasing annual growth in loans to households on the one side, and negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other side. while the lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle, the data over the past few months point to a possible discontinuation of the earlier downward trend in annual loan growth. the latest data also confirm that the reduction in the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year. however, further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. to address this challenge, banks should turn to the market and use present funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases. to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all new information since our meeting on 8 april 2010, we expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. global inflationary pressures – driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world – are still being counteracted by low domestic price pressures. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. we expect the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, but growth patterns could be uneven in an environment of high uncertainty. a cross- check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. monetary policy will do all that is necessary to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.  as regards fiscal policies, we call for decisive actions by governments to achieve a lasting and credible consolidation of public finances. the latest information shows that the correction of the large fiscal imbalances will, in general, require a stepping-up of current efforts. fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact. the longer the fiscal correction is postponed, the greater the adjustment needs become and the higher the risk of reputational and confidence losses. instead, the swift implementation of frontloaded and comprehensive consolidation plans, focusing on the expenditure side and combined with structural reforms, will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to regain sustainability of public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. in this context, the governing council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was approved by the greek government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the european commission, in liaison with the ecb, and the international monetary fund, with a view to safeguarding financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  for all euro area countries, structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery. in view of the recent rise in unemployment, tax and benefit systems that set effective incentives to work, improved training schemes and sufficient flexibility in labour contracts are required in order to avoid an increase in structural unemployment. at the same time, existing competitiveness problems, as well as domestic and external imbalances, need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned. to that end, wage-bargaining institutions that allow wages to adjust appropriately to losses in competitiveness and the unemployment situation are indispensable. likewise, measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential. finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100408.en.html,8 April 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 march 2010, price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. overall, the governing council expects the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment of uncertainty, with the growth pattern possibly being uneven owing to a number of special factors. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. benefiting from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system, the euro area economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2009, after a period of sharp decline, while in the fourth quarter real gdp was flat, according to eurostat’s second release. available indicators, in particular further positive information from business surveys, suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010, although it may have been affected by a number of special factors, including adverse weather conditions. as a consequence, euro area real gdp growth is likely to have remained uneven around the turn of the year, making it advisable to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a half-yearly basis. looking ahead, the governing council expects real gdp growth to continue to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being hampered by weak labour market prospects. the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment of uncertainty. on the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected. furthermore, there may be greater than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. on the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and the intensification of protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.5% in march 2010, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 0.9% in february. while no breakdown of overall hicp developments is available yet, this higher than expected outcome may be related in particular to the energy component as well as food prices, possibly partly as a result of weather conditions. inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon in line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 was -0.4% in february. annual growth in loans to the private sector also remained weak, at -0.4%, despite a positive flow in the month. overall, the latest data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that, in the medium term, the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low. the growth of m3 and loans is likely to remain weak also in the coming months.  the continued steep yield curve fosters the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside m3 and implies that actual m3 growth is weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion. at the same time, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of holding funds in the most liquid components included in m1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 10.9% in february. however, the monthly flows in the components of m3 were generally small in february, suggesting that the strong impact of the prevailing interest rate constellation may be progressively waning. the negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments: positive, strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand, and negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand. at the same time, the flow of loans to firms in february was positive for the first time since august 2009 and halted the decline in the annual growth rate. such positive short-term developments need to be assessed with caution, owing to the volatility in monthly data. in addition, it is a normal feature of the business cycle that loans to non-financial corporations remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up. the reduction in the size of banks’ overall balance sheets appears to have come to a halt in the early months of 2010. however, the challenge remains for them to manage possible further adjustments while at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. to address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further, and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 march 2010, price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. overall, the governing council expects the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment of uncertainty, with the growth pattern possibly being uneven owing to a number of special factors. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  as regards fiscal policies, it is now essential that governments reduce budget imbalances and correct excessive deficits by the agreed deadlines. in a number of euro area countries, fiscal consolidation will start this year and in all others corrective measures will need to be in place by 2011 at the latest. fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact, and there is a need to fully define and implement credible fiscal adjustment strategies. this requires determined efforts, notably on the part of countries with high government deficit and debt-to-gdp ratios, not least in view of the expected rising budgetary costs associated with an ageing population. a strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed. the governing council welcomes the statement on greece made by the heads of state and government of the euro area countries on 25 march. we fully support the intention to strengthen surveillance of economic and budgetary risks and the instruments for their prevention as well as the excessive deficit procedure. we also welcome the decision to work on a robust crisis resolution framework. progress in these fields should aim to support the sustainability of public finances and promote the smooth functioning of emu.  regarding structural reforms, the agreements reached at the european council on 25 and 26 march on the europe 2020 strategy should help to reinforce job creation, competitiveness and sustainable growth. to this end, policies should now focus on increasing competition, while sectoral support schemes implemented during the crisis should be phased out. in labour markets, sufficient wage flexibility and a reinforcement of incentives to work are required, in order to avoid higher structural unemployment over the coming years. in the same vein, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector remains essential. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. regarding our collateral framework, the governing council has decided to keep the minimum credit threshold for marketable and non-marketable assets in the eurosystem collateral framework at investment-grade level (i.e. bbb-/baa3) beyond the end of 2010, except in the case of asset-backed securities (abss). in addition, the governing council has decided to apply, as of 1 january 2011, a schedule of graduated valuation haircuts to the assets rated in the bbb+ to bbb- range (or equivalent). this graduated haircut schedule will replace the uniform haircut add-on of 5% that is currently applied to these assets. the detailed haircut schedule will be based on a number of parameters which are specified in the press release to be published after today’s press conference",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged current rate remain appropriate account information analysis available price development expect

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100304.en.html,4 March 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 february 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. overall, the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  at today’s meeting we also discussed, in view of economic and financial market developments, how to proceed with the gradual phasing-out of our non-standard operational measures. in this respect, we decided to continue conducting both the main refinancing operations (mros) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary – and at least until the end of this year’s ninth maintenance period on 12 october 2010. in the case of the special-term refinancing operations, the fixed rate will be the same as the rate used in the respective mro. the governing council also decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations (ltros), starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 april 2010. allotment amounts in these operations will be set with the aim of ensuring smooth conditions in money markets and avoiding any significant spreads between bid rates and the prevailing mro rate. furthermore, the governing council decided, in line with its decision on the 12-month ltro of 16 december 2009, to fix the rate in the six-month ltro to be allotted on 31 march 2010 at the average minimum bid rate of the mros over the life of this operation. with today’s decisions, the eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area at very favourable conditions, thereby facilitating the provision of credit to the euro area. at the same time, these decisions help to avoid distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for longer than needed. the governing council will continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures. in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. over recent quarters, the euro area has continued to benefit from the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system, as well as from the ongoing recovery in the world economy. according to eurostat’s first release, in quarter-on-quarter terms euro area real gdp increased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009, after growing by 0.4% in the third quarter. available indicators suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. in particular, a number of special factors are at play, including adverse weather conditions in parts of the euro area in the first quarter of 2010. given this uneven pattern, it is more appropriate to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a half-yearly basis. looking ahead, the governing council expects real gdp growth to remain moderate in 2010, owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that the low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being dampened by weak labour market prospects. this assessment is also reflected in the march 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 0.4% and 1.2% for 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.5% for 2011. compared with the eurosystem staff projections published in december 2009, the range for real gdp growth in 2010 is slightly narrower, while for 2011 the range has been revised slightly upwards, reflecting notably stronger activity worldwide  the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. on the upside, confidence may improve more than expected, and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. furthermore, there may be larger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and renewed tensions in some financial market segments, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation was 0.9% in february 2010, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.0% in january. inflation is expected to be around 1% in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. in line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. in this context, it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this assessment is also reflected in the march 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 0.8% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 0.9% and 2.1% for 2011. compared with the eurosystem staff projections published in december 2009, the range for 2010 has been adjusted marginally downwards, while the range for 2011 has been adjusted slightly upwards. risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years.  turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 turned slightly positive in january 2010, rising to 0.1%. this reflects mainly a base effect and confirms the assessment of continued weak monetary growth. together with the negative annual rate of growth in loans to the private sector (equal to -0.6% in january 2010), the latest data support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that, in the medium term, the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low. the growth of m3 and loans to the private sector is likely to remain weak also in the coming months.  at the same time, actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, on account of the downward impact of the steep yield curve. this fosters the allocation of funds away from m3 and into longer-term deposits and securities. on the other hand, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in m1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 11.5% in january. the negative annual growth of loans to the private sector conceals ongoing opposite developments: positive, strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand and negative, declining annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand. such differences are consistent with historical patterns and cyclical regularities, which suggest that loans to non-financial corporations can be expected to remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up. at the same time, the cost of financing for enterprises has declined and the sector as a whole has continued to make extensive use of market-based financing as a substitute for bank financing. banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months, but the challenge remains for them to manage this adjustment while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. to address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 february 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. overall, the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  as regards fiscal policies, high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the stability and growth pact as a key pillar of economic and monetary union. it is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead. this requires determined efforts, notably on the side of countries with high deficit and debt levels. all countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures. consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact. a strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed. the governing council issued, on 3 march 2010, a statement on the additional fiscal consolidation measures announced by the greek government. in all euro area countries, the key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms. policies should be adopted which open up market access and increase competition. overall, it is essential to set the stage for long-term investment in innovation so as to create new business opportunities. sectoral support schemes implemented to cope with the immediate effects of the crisis should now be phased out. in labour markets, moderate wage setting in several economies and sufficient labour market flexibility are required in order to avoid higher structural unemployment over the coming years. these structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged current rate remain appropriate account information analysis available price development expect

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100204.en.html,4 February 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 14 january 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that euro area economic activity continued to expand around the turn of the year. looking ahead, the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. the recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the latest information confirms that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand around the turn of the year. the euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. however, these stimuli will unwind over time, while activity is likely to be adversely affected by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. in addition, low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment, and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth. for these reasons, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven. the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. on the upside, confidence may improve more than expected, and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. furthermore, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, euro area annual hicp inflation increased further in january 2010 to stand at 1.0%, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 0.9% in december 2009. inflation is expected to be around 1% in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. in this context, it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the further development of economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 remained negative in december 2009, standing at -0.2%. in the same period, annual growth in loans to the private sector was zero. these data continue to support our assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, owing to the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve. looking ahead, m3 and credit growth is likely to remain weak for some time to come.  the prevailing interest rate constellation continues to have a strong influence on both the level and composition of annual m3 growth. on the one hand, the low rates of remuneration on short-term bank deposits foster the allocation of funds away from m3 and into longer-term deposits and securities. on the other hand, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different short-term deposits imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in m1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of more than 12% in december. the zero annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector reflects a further increase in the growth in loans to households, while the annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations moved further into negative territory. such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities. the ongoing contraction in the outstanding amounts of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be accounted for entirely by a strong net redemption of loans with a short maturity. for the sector as a whole, the overall contraction may be due partly to substitution with market-based financing.  given the typical lags between turning points in economic activity and those in the demand for bank loans, growth in loans can be expected to remain weak over the months to come. in the meantime, the real cost of external financing for non-financial enterprises has declined further, while the net tightening of credit standards applied by banks has continued to diminish, as indicated by the bank lending survey for the last quarter of 2009. at the same time, banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months. in this respect, the challenge remains for banks to adjust the size and structure of their balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. to address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. this is important to facilitate access to finance, especially for those enterprises that do not have recourse to market-based financing.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 14 january 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that euro area economic activity continued to expand around the turn of the year. looking ahead, the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. the recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  we will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. the governing council will, in early march, take decisions on the continued implementation of the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. as regards fiscal policies, many euro area countries are faced with large, sharply rising fiscal imbalances, leading to less favourable medium and long-term interest rates and lower levels of private investment. moreover, high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the stability and growth pact as a key pillar of economic and monetary union. against this background, it is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead. countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures. consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact. a strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed. the key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms, as the financial crisis has negatively affected the productive capacity of our economies. in the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. in labour markets, moderate wage-setting, effective incentives to work and sufficient labour market flexibility are required in order to avoid significantly higher structural unemployment over the coming years. finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability",base regular

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100114.en.html,14 January 2010,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 december 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand. however, some of the factors supporting the growth in real gdp are of a temporary nature. overall, the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. following the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter increase in real gdp in the third quarter of 2009, the latest information confirms that towards the end of last year economic activity in the euro area continued to expand. the euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. however, a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature. furthermore, there is likely to be a drag on activity for some time to come on account of the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. in addition, low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment, and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth. for these reasons, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven. the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. on the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve further, and the global economy as well as foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, as expected, euro area annual hicp inflation increased further in december 2009 to stand at 0.9%, after 0.5% in november. the rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming mostly from the drop in global energy prices a year ago. inflation is expected to remain around 1% in the near term. looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall price, cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this context, it is important to emphasise, once again, that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, both the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector were negative in november, standing at -0.2% and -0.7% respectively. the concurrent declines to historically low growth rates recorded in these two series over the past months support the assessment of a decelerating underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. looking ahead, m3 and credit growth are likely to remain very weak or negative for some time to come. the decline in actual monetary growth is likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion. this is due to the continued steep slope of the yield curve, which explains shifts of funds out of m3 into longer-term deposits and securities. at the same time, the interest rate constellation continues to foster divergent developments in the main components of m3, as the narrow spreads between the rates on different short-term bank deposits reduce the opportunity costs of shifting funds from, for instance, short-term time deposits into overnight deposits. as a result, m1 continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 12.6% in november, when annual m3 growth turned negative. the negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector conceals a return to positive annual rates of growth in the case of loans to households, while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations became more negative. such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities, with turning points in the growth of loans to enterprises typically lagging those in economic activity. in the case of households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates. in the case of non-financial corporations, the decline in loans continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity, while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive. the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, will probably continue to dampen firms’ demand for bank financing in the months to come. in the meantime, financing conditions for enterprises have improved over recent months in terms of the cost of both bank credit and market financing. in this respect, the continued negative flows in short-term bank loans to non-financial corporations observed in recent months may partly reflect better possibilities for substitution with different sources of longer-term financing.  banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets, mainly through downsizing the assets held vis-à-vis other banks. the challenge remains to adjust the size and structure of balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. to address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 december 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand. however, some of the factors supporting the growth in real gdp are of a temporary nature. overall, the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. we will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. the governing council will also continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. as regards fiscal policies, many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances. the very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment, leading to less favourable medium and long-term market interest rates. this, in turn, would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for sustained growth. moreover, high levels of public deficit and debt would place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the credibility of the provisions of both the treaty on european union and the stability and growth pact as a key pillar of economic and monetary union. the governing council therefore calls upon governments to decide and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions, with a strong focus on expenditure reforms. tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre. in this regard, current government commitments to start consolidation in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark for adjustment of 0.5% of gdp per annum represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries. the success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend, crucially, on appropriate national budgetary rules and institutions and requires transparent budgetary procedures, as well as reliable and complete government finance statistics.  turning to structural reforms, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability.  the eurosystem will submit its response to the european commission’s public consultation on the eu 2020 strategy, which is designed as a successor to the current lisbon strategy. to address future challenges, the eu 2020 strategy should focus on raising potential growth and creating high levels of employment through well-functioning labour and product markets, sound financial systems and sustainable fiscal policies. the aim is to achieve a highly competitive social market economy, as spelled out in the treaty",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged current rate remain

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is091203.en.html,3 December 2009,"based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 november 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real gdp growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. however, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. at today’s meeting we also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (mros) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as is needed – and at least until the third maintenance period of 2010 ends on 13 april. we will continue to use this tender procedure in our special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue for at least the first three maintenance periods of 2010. moreover, we decided that the rate in the last 12-month longer-term refinancing operation, to be allotted on 16 december 2009, will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the mros over the life of this operation. finally, as regards longer-term refinancing operations in the first quarter of 2010, we decided to carry out the last six-month longer-term refinancing operation on 31 march 2010. this operation will be carried out using a full allotment fixed rate tender procedure, as will the regular monthly three-month longer-term refinancing operations already announced for the first quarter of 2010.  further operational details on these decisions can be found in a press release that will be posted on our website after this press conference. the improved conditions in financial markets have indicated that not all our liquidity measures are needed to the same extent as in the past. with these decisions, the eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area for an extended period at very favourable conditions and to facilitate the provision of credit to the euro area economy.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. economic activity in the euro area improved further in the third quarter of 2009, with real gdp growth returning to positive territory following five quarters of contraction. according to eurostat’s first estimate, real gdp increased by 0.4 % quarter on quarter. available survey data suggest that the recovery is continuing during the fourth quarter of 2009. at present, the euro area is benefiting from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. however, a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature and activity is likely to be affected for some time to come by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector, both inside and outside the euro area. for this reason, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010, and the recovery process is likely to be uneven. eurosystem staff project annual real gdp growth of between -4.1% and -3.9% in 2009, between +0.1% and +1.5% in 2010, and between +0.2% and +2.2% in 2011. the range for 2010 has been revised upwards compared with the september 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections. forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the december 2009 eurosystem staff projections. the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. on the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve further and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, as expected, euro area annual hicp inflation has turned positive again after five months of negative rates. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it stood at +0.6% in november, up from -0.1% in october. the rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming from the drop in global commodity prices a year ago. inflation is expected to rise further in the near term, mainly owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components. looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall price, cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. consistent with this assessment, the december 2009 eurosystem staff projections foresee annual hicp inflation of 0.3% in 2009, between 0.9% and 1.7% in 2010, and between 0.8% and 2.0% in 2011. compared with the september 2009 ecb staff projections, the inflation projections for 2010 remain largely unchanged. available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years.  turning to the monetary analysis, the data for october confirm the ongoing decline in the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector, to 0.3% and -0.8% respectively. these concurrent declines continue to support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. at the same time, the annual growth rate of m1 was 11.8% in october 2009, down from 12.8% in september, mainly reflecting a base effect. the current decline in the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates is influenced by a number of special factors and is thereby likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion. first, base effects associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil in autumn 2008 have had a downward effect on the annual growth rate of m3 in the past two months. second, and more fundamentally, the steep slope of the yield curve provides an incentive to shift funds out of m3 into longer-term deposits and securities, thereby dampening m3 growth. the current constellation of interest rates also continues to trigger shifts of funds within m3, as the narrow spread between the rates on different short-term deposits reduces the opportunity costs of holding the most liquid assets contained in m1. the annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned somewhat more negative in october. in the case of loans to households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates of growth. as regards loans to non-financial corporations, it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity. in this respect, the still subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, are likely to dampen firms’ demand for bank financing also in the coming months, especially for short-term loans. at the same time, overall financing conditions continue to improve, which should support the demand for loans in the period ahead. banks are currently faced with the challenge of managing the size and structure of their overall balance sheets, and at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. against the background of their improved liquidity situation and access to market financing, banks should address this challenge by taking appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. to sum up, the current rates remain appropriate. taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 november 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. the latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real gdp growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. however, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. all in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households.  with all the measures we have taken in response to the intensification of the financial crisis, we have supported both the availability of liquidity to the banking sector and the recovery of the euro area economy. as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will continue to progressively feed through to the economy. we will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. looking ahead, the governing council will gradually phase out, at the appropriate time, the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. in this way, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. as regards fiscal policies, we re-emphasise how important it is for governments to develop, communicate and implement ambitious fiscal consolidation strategies in a timely manner. these strategies must be based on realistic output growth assumptions and focus on structural expenditure reforms, not least with a view to coping with the budgetary burden associated with an ageing population. as agreed by the ecofin council on 2 december 2009, governments need to set out concrete and quantifiable adjustment measures that will lead to a sustainable correction of fiscal imbalances. several countries will have to start consolidation in 2010, and all others in 2011 at the latest.  with regard to structural reforms, most estimates indicate that the financial crisis has reduced the productive capacity of our economies, and will continue to do so for some time to come. in order to support sustainable growth and employment, labour market flexibility and more effective incentives to work will be needed. furthermore, policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role. sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability",base regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is091105.en.html,5 November 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. the incoming information and analyses that have become available since our meeting in early october have confirmed our expectations. while annual hicp inflation was -0.1% in october, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. the governing council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace, recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. available data and survey-based indicators continue to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. in particular, the euro area should benefit from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. taking into account all available information, in the second half of this year, quarterly real gdp growth rates could be back in positive territory. however, uncertainty remains high as a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature. looking through the volatility of incoming data, the euro area economy is expected to recover at a gradual pace in 2010, as it is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector, both inside and outside the euro area.  in the view of the governing council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. on the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve more quickly, the labour market deterioration may be less marked than previously expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation stood at -0.1% in october, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with -0.3% in september. the current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect mainly movements in global commodity prices over the last year. in the coming months, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again, also relating to base effects. thereafter, over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation is expected to remain positive, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector declined further in september, to 1.8% and -0.3% respectively. these concurrent declines support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. in the next few months, the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates will most likely be affected downwards by base effects that are associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil one year ago. more fundamentally, however, the growth of m1 and m3 continues to reflect the current constellation of interest rates. while the narrow spread between the rates on different short-term deposits fosters shifts in the allocation of funds to the most liquid assets contained in m1, the steep slope of the yield curve also encourages such shifts from m3 to longer-term deposits and securities outside m3. the annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned slightly negative in september, with annual loan growth to both non-financial corporations and households declining further and being negative. at the same time, the monthly flows of loans to households remained positive and even increased, while those of loans to non-financial corporations were negative. in the case of households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates. in the case of non-financial corporations, the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, continue to dampen firms’ demand for bank financing, a tendency which is likely to prevail in the coming months. in this respect, it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically only picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity. at the same time, the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation.  to sum up, the current rates remain appropriate. the incoming information and analyses that have become available since our meeting in early october have confirmed our expectations. while annual hicp inflation was -0.1% in october, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. the governing council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace, recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households.  as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy. hence, with all the measures we have taken, monetary policy has been supporting the availability of liquidity and the recovery of the euro area economy. looking ahead, and taking into account the improved conditions in financial markets, not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past. accordingly, the governing council will make sure that the extraordinary liquidity measures taken are phased out in a timely and gradual fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. by so doing, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. as regards fiscal policies, many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances. if not addressed by a clear and credible exit strategy, this could seriously risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances and the economic recovery. the very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment, leading to less favourable medium and long-term interest rates. this in turn would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for a return to sustained growth. moreover, high public deficits and debts may complicate the task of the single monetary policy to maintain price stability. the governing council therefore calls upon governments to communicate and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions, with a strong focus on expenditure reforms. tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre. in this regard, the recent ecofin council conclusions, which call for consolidation to start in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark of 0.5% of gdp per annum, represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries. the success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend crucially on the transparency of the budgetary procedures and the reliability and completeness of government finance statistics. this is an area in which quick and decisive progress is indispensable for the countries concerned and for the euro area as a whole.  turning to structural reforms, in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies. moderate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work are required in order to avoid significantly higher structural unemployment over the coming years. policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role. sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and

interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate. the incoming information and analyses since our last meeting in early september have confirmed our previous assessment. while annual hicp inflation was still slightly negative in september, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. at the same time, the latest information further supports our view that the euro area economy is stabilising and is expected to recover at a gradual pace. however, uncertainty remains high. as regards medium to longer-term inflation expectations, they remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to moderate. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. available survey indicators continue to signal an ongoing stabilisation of economic activity. in particular, the euro area should benefit from a recovery in exports, the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system. in addition, following the substantial negative contributions in the first half of 2009, the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively to real gdp growth in the second half of the year. however, uncertainty remains high and the volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of the available information. overall, the recovery is expected to remain rather uneven. it will be supported in the short term by a number of temporary factors but is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and the non-financial sector of the economy, both inside and outside the euro area. in the view of the governing council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. on the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve more quickly, the labour market deterioration may be less marked than previously expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances.   with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation stood at -0.3% in september, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with -0.2% in august. the current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago. also owing to base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again in the coming months. thereafter, over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to the evolution of commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm that developments in broad money and credit growth remain subdued. in august, the annual growth of m3 and loans to the private sector declined further to historically low rates of 2.5% and 0.1% respectively. this parallel deceleration in money and credit growth confirms our previous assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. the ongoing deceleration in annual m3 growth has continued to be accompanied by a strengthening in annual m1 growth, which in august rose further to 13.6%. the strength of m1 reflects the fact that narrower spreads between the rates on different short-term deposits have fostered shifts in the allocation of funds from, in particular, short-term time deposits to overnight deposits. at the same time, the steep slope of the yield curve may have supported shifts from m3 to longer-term deposits and securities outside m3.  the overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in august. in the case of households, the latest data suggest that the decline in loan growth has been levelling off at low rates of expansion. in the case of non-financial corporations, following a few months of negative flows, the flow of loans was again slightly positive in august. looking through the volatility in monthly data, loan growth continues to be very subdued. this is in line with the lag that normally prevails between trends in economic activity and developments in loans to enterprises. in this respect, given the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the business outlook, further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely. at the same time, the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation.   to sum up, the current rates remain appropriate. the incoming information and analyses since our last meeting in early september have confirmed our previous assessment. while annual hicp inflation was still slightly negative in september, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at

medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to moderate. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. hence, with all the measures taken, including our latest 12-month longer-term refinancing operation of 30 september, monetary policy is providing strong ongoing support to the economy. once the macroeconomic environment improves, the governing council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. by so doing, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. as regards fiscal policies, the need for ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies is becoming increasingly pressing. it is vital that governments put in place concrete structural measures and convincingly communicate that they are committed to ensuring the sustainability of public finances. governments should design their consolidation plans in line with the provisions of the stability and growth pact, ensuring that consolidation starts as soon as possible and at the latest when the recovery takes hold. these plans should also be accompanied by a strengthening of national budgetary frameworks. consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011 and will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact. in countries with high deficit and/or debt ratios, the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of gdp. in view of the rapidly increasing public expenditure ratios, as well as projected further expenditure pressures owing to higher interest burdens and ageing-related costs, countries’ structural measures should focus on the expenditure side. turning to structural reforms, in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies. in particular, appropriate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work are required. at the same time, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery. an appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector should also play an important role.

interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate, taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our last meeting on 6 august 2009. in this respect, at today’s meeting we also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 september 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations. this decision, which continues to guarantee liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area for an extended period of time at very favourable conditions, should promote the extension of credit to the euro area economy and, therefore, further underpin its recovery. price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. annual hicp inflation was slightly negative in august according to eurostat’s flash estimate. this reflects mainly the base effects of the strong rise in commodity prices in 2008. the return of hicp inflation to moderate positive rates is expected within the coming months. at the same time, the latest information supports our view that there are increasing signs of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere. this is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. following the strong negative growth rates observed around the turn of the year, according to eurostat’s first estimate, economic activity in the euro area declined only slightly in the second quarter of 2009, contracting by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter. survey indicators for the third quarter of 2009 support the view that the euro area economy is stabilising further. in the near term, the euro area should continue to benefit from a recovery in exports, the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system. in addition, the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively. however, uncertainty remains high and the persistent volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of available information. overall, the recovery is expected to be rather uneven, given the temporary nature of some of the supporting factors and the ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and non-financial sectors of the economy, both inside and outside the euro area. this assessment is broadly in line with the september 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. according to these projections, average annual real gdp growth will range between -4.4% and -3.8% in 2009 and between -0.5% and +0.9% in 2010. compared with the june 2009 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, this implies an upward revision of the ranges for both 2009 and 2010, reflecting mainly the recent, more positive developments and information. forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the september 2009 ecb staff projections. in the view of the governing council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. on the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve more quickly, labour market deterioration may be less marked than currently expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the still strained financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and a disorderly correction of global imbalances. at the same time, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains higher than usual.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation was, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, -0.2% in august , compared with -0.7% in july. this development is in line with previous expectations and reflects largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago. owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again within the coming months. looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this context, it is important to re-emphasise that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this outlook is consistent with the september 2009 ecb staff projections for euro area inflation. in these projections, annual hicp inflation is projected to range between 0.2% and 0.6% in 2009 and between 0.8% and 1.6% in 2010, revised slightly upwards from the june 2009 eurosystem staff projections, reflecting mainly upward revisions to energy prices. available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture.  risks to the outlook for price developments remain broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in both broad money and credit growth. in july, the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector declined further to 3.0% and 0.6% respectively, reaching new lows since 1999. these developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term.  the short-term developments of m3 and its components have remained volatile. the recent changes in interest rates paid on the different instruments included in m3 have continued to underlie the strong shifts in the allocation of funds from, in particular, short-term time deposits to overnight deposits. the deceleration in annual m3 growth has thus continued to combine with a substantial further strengthening of annual m1 growth, which in july rose to 12.1%. in addition, the relatively steep yield curve and the re-emergence of risk appetite, reflected particularly in the increase in stock prices over the past few months, may have dampened m3 growth to some extent.  the overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in july, with the differences across borrowing sectors becoming more marked. the flow of loans to households remained slightly positive, whereas in the case of non-financial corporations the flow of loans was negative again. the decline in loans to non-financial corporations continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity, while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive. the fall in production and trade and the ongoing uncertainty in the business outlook are likely to have dampened firms’ demand for financing. given the normal lag between a recovery in economic activity and a pick-up in loans to enterprises, further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely. at the same time, a gradual improvement in financing conditions, as lower market interest rates continue to be passed on in lower bank lending rates, should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation.  to sum up, the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 6 august 2009 confirms the view of the governing council that the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. in this respect, at today’s meeting we also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 september 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations. price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. annual hicp inflation was slightly negative in august. this reflects mainly the base effects of the strong rise in commodity prices in 2008. the return of hicp inflation to moderate positive rates is expected within the coming months. at the same time, the latest information supports our view that there are increasing signs of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere. this is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery . available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy is providing ongoing support for households and corporations. once the macroeconomic environment improves, the governing council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. by so doing, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. as regards fiscal policies, the latest quarterly euro area data and developments in individual countries confirm a substantial deterioration of fiscal positions in 2009, which is projected to continue in 2010. in finalising their 2010 budgets and medium-term fiscal plans, governments must now substantiate their commitment to ensuring a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances in line with the stability and growth pact. in particular, it is crucial that ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies, underpinned by concrete structural measures, are put in place. the structural adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and the consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011. structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact. in countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios, the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of gdp. the focus of the structural measures should lie on the expenditure side, as in most euro area countries tax and social contribution rates are already high.  turning to structural policies, it is likely that the financial crisis will affect the growth potential in the euro area. this outlook reinforces the need to strengthen reform efforts to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. it requires, in particular, appropriate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work. at the same time, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery. in this respect, an appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector plays an important role. sound balance sheets, solid risk management, and transparent and robust business models are key to strengthening the financial soundness of banks and their resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability",regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged current rate

remain weak, although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. this assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. the data and survey information that have become available since our meeting on 2 july 2009 have broadly confirmed our previous expectations. while uncertainty is still high, there are increasingly signs that the global recession is bottoming out. as regards the euro area, recent surveys suggest that the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. however, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to remain weak. looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. the significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally, including in the euro area.  in the view of the governing council, uncertainty remains high and we have to be prepared for ongoing volatility in incoming data. overall, the risks to this outlook remain balanced. on the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. on the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures, more unfavourable than expected labour market conditions and, lastly, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation was, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, -0.6 % in july, compared with -0.1% in june. this further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from the peaks observed in global commodity prices a year ago.  looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory, before turning positive again later this year. however, such short-term movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. consistent with available forecasts and projections, looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, while price and cost developments are expected to remain subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this respect, indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to the outlook for inflation are broadly balanced. they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the ongoing deceleration in broad money and credit growth. the annual growth rates of m3 and of loans to the private sector recorded in june – 3.5% and 1.5% respectively – are the lowest since the start of stage three of emu. these developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. the declining pace of monetary expansion since the last quarter of 2008 continues to be accompanied by volatility in the short-term developments of m3 and its components. this reflects to a large extent the impact that absolute and relative changes in interest rates have had on the allocation of funds between financial investments inside and outside m3 and between the different deposit categories within m3. in this respect, the shift in allocation from short-term time deposits to overnight deposits within m3 has led to a further substantial strengthening of annual m1 growth in june.  the flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in june, albeit with differences across borrowing sectors. the flow of loans to non-financial corporations turned substantially more negative owing to a sharp contraction in short-term lending. at the same time, the flow of loans to households was slightly more positive than last month. the ongoing uncertainty seems to have dampened borrowers’ demand for financing. however, according to the latest euro area bank lending survey, lenders tightened their credit standards to a significantly lesser extent. given the challenges that lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation.  to sum up, the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 2 july 2009 confirm the view of the governing council that the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate. as anticipated, annual hicp inflation in july fell further into negative territory, reflecting mainly temporary effects. after a return to positive inflation rates during the second half of the year, we continue to expect price developments to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. recent data releases and survey information still suggest that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak, although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. this assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full. hence, with all the measures taken, including our covered bond purchases, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. once the macroeconomic environment improves, the governing council will take care that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the ample liquidity provided is absorbed. hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term will be effectively countered in a timely fashion. the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding fiscal policy, we welcome the position of the eurogroup that, given the current economic outlook and projected public deficit and debt developments, further fiscal stimulus is not warranted. budget plans for 2010, which are currently being finalised in a number of countries, and medium-term consolidation strategies must reflect a commitment to a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances. accordingly, governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the stability and growth pact. the structural adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and in 2011 the consolidation efforts should be stepped up. structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact. in countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of gdp. given the risks of lower potential economic growth in the euro area for a prolonged period of time, governments should adjust public expenditures appropriately to the new macroeconomic conditions and reverse the sharp rises in public expenditure ratios as soon as possible. this is necessary also to prepare budgets for future ageing-induced expenditure burdens. turning to structural policies, there is a need to intensify structural reform efforts in order to support sustainable growth in the euro area. appropriate wage-setting and sufficient flexibility to get the unemployed back into work are crucial to prevent the crisis from having a lasting negative impact on labour markets. it is therefore essential to create appropriate incentives to work. at the same time, policies to speed up restructuring and investment, in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition, will create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to spark a sustained recovery",regular economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090702.en.html,2 July 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 june 2009. the fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in june is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects. after a return to positive inflation rates, we expect price developments to remain dampened over the policy-relevant horizon. recent data releases and survey information provide further indications that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. this assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit indicators continue to be weak. against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. the data and survey information that have become available since our last press conference in early june have broadly confirmed our previous expectations. economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. the significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally, including in the euro area.  in the view of the governing council, the risks to the economic outlook are balanced. on the positive side, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. on the other hand, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets, further increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures, increasingly unfavourable labour markets and, lastly, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation was, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, -0.1 % in june, compared with 0.0% in may. as explained on previous occasions, the further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from past sharp swings in global commodity prices.  looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory over the coming months, before turning positive again. such short-term movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. consistent with available forecasts and projections, looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, while price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. in this respect, indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to the outlook for inflation are broadly balanced. on the downside they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity, while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in monetary dynamics. in may, the annual growth rate of m3 declined further to 3.7%, with that of loans to the private sector falling further to 1.8% – the lowest rates since the start of stage three of economic and monetary union. this concurrent deceleration supports the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. in may, the outstanding amounts of most components of m3 showed a contraction, reflecting, to a large extent, the recent declines in interest rates paid on short-term deposits and marketable instruments and the increased allocation of funds to instruments outside m3 that these may have fostered. following a substantial strengthening in april, the growth of m1, while having remained strong, also moderated in may. the short-term developments in m3 have been volatile over the past few months. looking beyond this volatility, the pace of monetary expansion has clearly slowed since the last quarter of 2008. the flow of bank loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained subdued, reflecting in part the weakening in economic activity and the continued low levels of business and consumer confidence. a moderate monthly contraction in the outstanding amount of loans to non-financial corporations has been observed over recent months. these developments are mostly due to a decline in short-term lending, while the flow of loans with longer maturities has remained slightly positive. in this respect, it is important to note that past reductions in key ecb rates have continued to be passed on through lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households. the resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead. however, as we have stressed in the past given the challenges that lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. to sum up, the current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 june 2009. the fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in june is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects. after a return to positive inflation rates, we expect price developments to remain dampened over the policy-relevant horizon. recent data releases and survey information provide further indications that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. this assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit indicators continue to be weak. against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households.  as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full. hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. the governing council would like to recall that the eurosystem provided a significant amount of liquidity to euro area banks at its recent first 12-month longer-term refinancing operation. this operation at a fixed interest rate of 1% is expected to strengthen further the liquidity position of banks and to support the normalisation of money markets and the extension of credit to the economy alongside the other measures of enhanced credit support. once the macroeconomic environment improves, the governing council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the liquidity provided is absorbed. hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. as has been emphasised many times, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  as regards fiscal policies, the governing council welcomes the spring 2009 orientations for euro area fiscal policies as agreed by the euro area finance ministers in june. a return to sound, sustainable public finances, thus strengthening overall macroeconomic stability, must be ensured. against this background, euro area governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the stability and growth pact. in the view of the governing council, the structural adjustment process should start in any case not later than the economic recovery. in 2011 the consolidation efforts should be stepped up. to correct the envisaged large fiscal imbalances of euro area countries, structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact. in countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of gdp.  turning to structural policies, there is a need to intensify efforts to support potential growth in the euro area. given the negative impact of the financial crisis on employment, investment and the capital stock, it is crucial to accelerate the implementation of necessary structural reforms. in particular, product market reforms are required to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth. furthermore, labour market reforms need to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions. at the same time, many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy should be phased out in a timely manner. it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition",regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged current rate remain

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090604.en.html,4 June 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the current rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early may, including the enhanced credit support measures, and all the information and analyses which have become available since then. we confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. recent survey information indicates that, following two quarters of very negative growth, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. after a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. this assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. at the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure, as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in some more detail, starting with the economic analysis. reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, and in particular a sharp fall in global demand and trade, economic activity weakened considerably in the first quarter of 2009. according to eurostat’s first estimate, economic activity in the euro area contracted by 2.5% quarter on quarter, after a decline of 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008. this will have a significant negative impact on the average growth rate for 2009. however, more recently, there have been improvements in survey data, albeit at very low levels. in line with such evidence, after the extremely weak first quarter, activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. after a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010.  this assessment is broadly in line with the june 2009 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real gdp growth will range between -5.1% and -4.1% in 2009 and between -1.0% and 0.4% in 2010. compared with the march 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been revised downwards, in particular for 2009. a substantial negative carry-over effect from the previous year and the very weak result for the first quarter of 2009 significantly contributed to this downward revision. the projected gradual recovery next year, with rates of growth returning to positive levels by mid-2010, reflects the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the june 2009 eurosystem staff projections, taking into account the results of the first quarter.  in the view of the governing council, the risks to the economic outlook are balanced. on the positive side, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and from other policy measures taken. confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. on the other hand, concerns remain relating to the following potential factors: a stronger impact on the real economy from the turmoil in financial markets, more unfavourable developments in labour markets, the intensification of protectionist pressures and, finally, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation was, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, 0.0% in may, compared with 0.6% in april. as explained on earlier occasions, the further decline in inflation rates was fully anticipated and primarily reflects base effects resulting from the sharp swings in global commodity prices over the past 12 months.  looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to decline further and temporarily remain negative over the coming months, before returning to positive territory by the end of 2009. such short-term movements are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. looking further ahead, price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. this outlook is consistent with the june 2009 eurosystem staff projections for euro area inflation, in which annual hicp inflation is seen to range between 0.1% and 0.5% in 2009, revised slightly downwards from the march 2009 ecb staff projections. for 2010, eurosystem staff project annual hicp inflation to range between 0.6% and 1.4%, broadly unchanged from the march 2009 ecb staff projections. available forecasts from international organisations provide a similar picture.  against this background, it is again important to stress that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. risks to these projections are broadly balanced. on the downside, these risks relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity, while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices. furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and thus support the assessment of moderate inflationary pressures. in april, the annual growth rate of m3 declined further to 4.9% and that of loans to the private sector to 2.4%. however, especially with regard to m3 growth, the pace of decline in annual growth rates was slower than in previous months, reflecting a brisk growth in monetary aggregates in april. the latest developments in m3 components continue to reflect to a large extent the impact of past reductions in key ecb interest rates, which have led to declines both in the levels of different deposit interest rates and in the spreads between them. this has implied, for instance, lower opportunity costs for market participants to shift funds into highly liquid overnight deposits and explains the strengthening of annual m1 growth to 8.4% in april. at the same time, the reduced remuneration of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments continues to foster the allocation of funds to instruments outside m3.  the outstanding amount of mfi loans to the private sector contracted somewhat further in april. this development is again mainly due to a negative flow of short-term lending to non-financial corporations, which partly reflects a lower need for working capital in view of the sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects during the first few months of the year, and greater recourse to liquidity buffers in financing such working capital. by contrast, longer-term lending to non-financial corporations remained positive. the past reductions in key ecb rates have continued to be passed on to lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households. the resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead. however, given the challenges which lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to further strengthen their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of the government measures to support the financial sector, in particular as regards recapitalisation. to sum up, the current key ecb interest rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early may, including the enhanced credit support measures, and all the information and analyses which have become available since then. we confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. recent survey information indicates that, following two quarters of very negative growth, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. after a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. this assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. at the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure, as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis. against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. once the macroeconomic environment improves, the governing council will ensure that the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed. hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. as has been emphasised many times, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding fiscal policies, the latest projections by the european commission point to a sharp increase in the euro area general government deficit and debt ratios in 2009. the deficit ratio is projected to rise to 5.3% of gdp in 2009 and further to 6.5% in 2010, from 1.9% in 2008, with the debt ratio exceeding 80% of gdp in 2010. a large majority of euro area countries are expected to exceed the 3% of gdp deficit reference value in 2009 and 2010. to ensure trust in the sustainability of public finances, an ambitious and credible adjustment effort will be required to return as soon as possible to sound fiscal positions, supported by a full application of the provisions of the stability and growth pact. the rapid attainment of sound fiscal positions will be necessary to enable countries to deal with the additional fiscal burden owing to demographic ageing as well as the risks arising from government guarantees that were provided to stabilise financial sectors. turning to structural policies, there is a strong case for undertaking further efforts to support potential growth in the euro area. it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy. in this respect, the current situation can be seen as a catalyst to accelerate the implementation of necessary domestic reforms, notably labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions, as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth. at the same time, many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy need to be phased out in a timely manner",regular

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090507.en.html,7 May 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by a further 25 basis points and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 50 basis points, to 1.00% and 1.75% respectively. the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%. this decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem since 8 october 2008 to 325 basis points.  current key ecb interest rates are appropriate taking into account all available information and analysis. in addition to the reductions in interest rates, the governing council decided today to proceed with its enhanced credit support approach. in continuity and consistency with the operations we have undertaken since october 2008, and in recognition of the central role played by the banking system in financing the euro area economy, we will conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 12 months. the operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. the rate for the first of these operations, to be announced on 23 june 2009, will be the rate on the main refinancing operations at that time. subsequently, the fixed rate may include a premium to the rate on the main refinancing operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.  the governing council has decided in principle that the eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area. the detailed modalities will be announced after the governing council meeting of 4 june 2009.  furthermore, the governing council has decided that the european investment bank will become an eligible counterparty in the eurosystem’s monetary policy operations with effect from 8 july 2009 and under the same conditions as any other counterparty. these decisions have been taken to promote the ongoing decline in money market term rates, to encourage banks to maintain and expand their lending to clients, to help to improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt security market, and to ease funding conditions for banks and enterprises. today’s decisions take into account the expectation that price developments will continue to be dampened by the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. the latest economic data and survey information suggest tentative signs of a stabilisation at very low levels, after a first quarter which was significantly weaker than expected. the world economy, including the euro area, is still undergoing a severe downturn, with the prospect of both external and domestic demand remaining very weak over 2009 before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. this assessment incorporates a number of adverse developments which are likely to materialise over the coming months, such as a further deterioration in labour markets. at the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing, as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months. against the background of these developments, after today’s decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. let me now explain our assessment in some more detail, starting with the economic analysis. reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, economic activity continued to weaken in the euro area in the course of the first quarter of 2009, in parallel with the ongoing downturn in the world economy. this weakening in the first quarter appears to have been significantly more pronounced than projected in march. more recently, there have been some tentative signs in survey data of a stabilisation, albeit at very low levels. overall, economic activity is likely to be very weak for the remainder of this year, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. in particular, the substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption. in addition, external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area.  taking all these measures and their effects into account, as well as the pronouncedly negative growth in the first quarter of this year and the most recently published forecasts by public institutions, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. on the downside, there are concerns that the turmoil in financial markets could have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as that protectionist pressures could intensify and that there could be adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. at the same time, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to the policy measures taken.  annual hicp inflation was, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, 0.6% in april, unchanged from march. as explained on earlier occasions, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period. moreover, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging. looking ahead, base effects stemming from past energy price movements will play a significant role in the shorter-term dynamics of the hicp. accordingly, we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further and temporarily remaining at negative levels for some months around mid-year. thereafter, annual inflation rates are expected to increase again. such short-term dynamics are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. looking further ahead, hicp inflation is likely to remain positive and below 2% in 2010, with price developments being dampened by ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. the risks surrounding this outlook are broadly balanced. they relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion. this is signalled, for instance, by the concurrent further declines in the annual growth rates of m3 to 5.1% and of loans to the private sector to 3.2%. the deceleration supports the assessment of diminishing inflationary pressures in the medium term.  month-on-month developments in m3 and its components have remained volatile, with data for march showing a contraction in most of the respective outstanding amounts. this may partly reflect market participants’ investment responses to the past reduction in the key ecb interest rates, which has reduced the remuneration of short-term deposits and marketable instruments and fostered corresponding shifts in the allocation of funds not only within m3 but also to instruments outside m3.  the outstanding amount of mfi loans to the private sector contracted further in march, reflecting mainly a negative flow of lending to non-financial corporations. the reduced amount of financing is again related mainly to loans with shorter maturities, while the net flow of loans with longer maturities remained positive. the decline in short-term lending is likely to reflect to a large extent lower demand in the wake of a sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects at the start of the year. interest rates on short-term and floating rate bank loans to households and non-financial corporations have declined significantly over recent months, indicating that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the economy continues. overall, the latest money and credit data support the assessment that both banks and money-holding sectors are reducing their highly leveraged positions built up in past years. to sum up, the governing council’s decisions today take into account the expectation that price developments will continue to be dampened by the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. the latest economic data and survey information suggest tentative signs of a stabilisation at very low levels, after a first quarter which was significantly weaker than expected. the world economy, including the euro area, is still undergoing a severe downturn, with the prospect of both external and domestic demand remaining very weak over 2009 before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. this assessment incorporates a number of adverse developments which are likely to materialise over the coming months, such as a further deterioration in labour markets. at the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing, as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months. against the background of these developments, after today’s decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. all in all, since the intensification of the financial crisis in september 2008, the eurosystem has taken a series of measures that are unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. as a consequence, we have observed a clear decline in key money market interest rates that euro area banks typically use as benchmarks to reset floating rate loans and price new short-term loans. this in turn has led to sharp declines in rates for such loans to households and non-financial corporations. as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy has provided ongoing support for households and corporations.  the governing council will ensure that, once the macroeconomic environment improves, the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed so that any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. indeed, as has been stressed many times, the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding fiscal policies, the latest projections for euro area countries point to continued revisions to budget balance estimates and forecasts. higher budget deficits and the fiscal impact of financial sector support measures will lead to significantly higher government debt-to-gdp ratios. in addition, updated projections by the economic policy committee of the eu show that most countries face a challenging task in dealing with the budgetary costs of an ageing population. therefore, it is paramount that countries make a strong and credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions, respecting fully the provisions of the stability and growth pact. this will preserve the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances and will support both the recovery and long-term economic growth. the credibility of fiscal consolidation commitments will be strengthened if they are part of national policy frameworks oriented to the medium term.  turning to structural policies, it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy. this calls for an accelerated implementation of labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring",regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide reduce

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090402.en.html,2 April 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by a further 25 basis points. this decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem since 8 october 2008 to 300 basis points.  today’s decision takes into account the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued, reflecting the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the world economy, including the euro area, is undergoing a severe downturn. both global and euro area demand are likely to remain very weak over 2009, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. after today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, economic activity has weakened markedly in the euro area, as domestic demand has contracted in parallel with the downturn in the world economy. available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area has remained very weak in early 2009. it is likely to remain very subdued for the remainder of the year but is expected to gradually recover in 2010. the substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption. in addition, external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area.  taking these effects into account, we see the risks to this outlook for economic activity as being broadly balanced. on the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to policy measures taken. on the other hand, there are concerns that the turmoil in financial markets could have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as that protectionist pressures could intensify and that there could be adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  annual hicp inflation has fallen further, from 1.2% in february to 0.6% in march, according to eurostat’s flash estimate as explained on earlier occasions, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period. moreover, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging. looking ahead, base effects stemming from past energy price effects will play a significant role in the shorter-term dynamics of the hicp. accordingly, we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further in the coming months and temporarily reaching negative levels around mid-year. thereafter, annual inflation rates should increase again. such short-term movements are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. looking further ahead, over the policy-relevant horizon, annual hicp inflation is expected to remain below 2% in 2010, reflecting mainly ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  the risks surrounding this outlook are broadly balanced. they relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the high month-to-month volatility of developments in m3 and its components observed since the intensification of the financial turmoil in september 2008. looking through this volatility, the pace of monetary expansion in the euro area has continued to decelerate markedly and supports the assessment of diminishing risks to price stability in the medium term.  developments within m3 clearly reflect market participants’ specific investment responses to the intensification of the financial turmoil, but increasingly also the impact of the past reduction in the key ecb interest rates. as this reduction has narrowed the gaps between the interest rates paid on the different categories of short-term deposits, it has fostered shifts in the allocation of funds. for example, the demand for overnight deposits further strengthened in february and contributed to the rise in the annual growth rate of m1 to 6.3%, while the demand for short-term time deposits weakened considerably. the flow of mfi loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained very subdued. the slightly negative flow of lending to non-financial corporations in february reflects a decline in the outstanding amount of loans with a shorter maturity, while the net flow in loans with longer maturities remained positive. the decline in short-term lending may be indicative of a reduction in loan demand related to the weakening of economic activity. however, supply effects have probably also affected loan developments. in this respect, developments over the past few months may in part reflect ongoing efforts of banks as well as the corporate and household sector to reduce the highly leveraged positions built up in past years.  to sum up, today’s decision takes into account the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued, reflecting the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the world economy, including the euro area, is undergoing a severe downturn. both global and euro area demand are likely to remain very weak over 2009, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. after today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. regarding fiscal policies, it is necessary that countries’ commitments to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions are credible, respecting fully the provisions of the stability and growth pact. this is essential to maintain the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances, which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting long-term growth. countries subject to the excessive deficit procedure need to comply strictly with the ecofin council recommendations for correcting their deficits. many countries will need to specify further credible consolidation measures for 2010 and beyond. full and consistent implementation of the eu’s legal provisions for sound fiscal policies is a prerequisite for the maintenance of their credibility as one of the pillars of the institutional framework of economic and monetary union. turning to structural reforms, the governing council welcomes the commitment of the spring european council to make full use of the renewed lisbon strategy for growth and jobs in the current situation. the updated recommendations for the euro area countries call for an accelerated implementation of reforms to support the economy, facilitate necessary adjustments and ensure a high level of growth potential. it remains essential that government support measures do not distort competition or delay necessary structural adjustment processes and that governments remain firmly committed to avoiding protectionism",regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide reduce key_interest_rate point

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090305.en.html,5 March 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided today to reduce the key ecb interest rates by a further 50 basis points. this decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem since 8 october 2008 to 275 basis points. overall, inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2% over 2009 and 2010. this outlook for inflation is due to the fall in commodity prices and diminishing domestic price and cost pressures, reflecting the severe downturn in economic activity. indeed, recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009. over the course of 2010, the economy is expected to gradually recover. at the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation at rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. after today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, which supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, the world economy has weakened substantially in recent months, affecting increasingly also emerging market economies. in a climate of heightened uncertainty, a severe fall in world trade volumes has been accompanied by a pronounced decline in domestic demand in the euro area. as a consequence, euro area real gdp contracted markedly in the fourth quarter of 2008, by 1.5% on a quarterly basis, according to eurostat’s first estimate. available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area remained weak in early 2009.  looking ahead, the governing council expects that both global and domestic demand will decline in 2009 but thereafter recover gradually. this assessment is also reflected in the march 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which place annual real gdp growth in a range of -3.2% to -2.2% in 2009, and between -0.7% and +0.7% in 2010. these ranges represent a downward revision of the december 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. in both 2009 and 2010, the annual gdp growth rate will be significantly reduced by negative carry-over effects from the previous year. the projected gradual recovery in 2010 reflects the effects of the substantial macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the extensive policy measures that have been introduced to restore the functioning of the financial system, both inside and outside the euro area. in addition, the fall in commodity prices is expected to support real disposable income and consumption in the period ahead. the outlook for the economy continues to be surrounded by uncertainty. in the view of the governing council, the risks to the economic outlook now appear to be more balanced. on the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects, also on confidence, stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and reflecting other policy measures taken. on the other hand, concerns relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has been steadily declining since the middle of 2008, when it reached a peak of 4.0%. in february 2009 it was 1.2%, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, broadly unchanged from 1.1% in january. the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period. however, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary risks are also increasingly emerging.  reflecting these trends, the march 2009 ecb staff inflation projections constitute a significant downward revision compared with the previous projections and foresee annual hicp inflation at between 0.1% and 0.7% in 2009. owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly temporarily reaching negative levels around mid-year. thereafter, annual inflation is expected to increase again, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments. accordingly, it is likely that hicp inflation rates will fluctuate noticeably during 2009. such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. for 2010, ecb staff project hicp inflation at between 0.6% and 1.4%. this range also represents a substantial downward revision compared with the december 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, mainly reflecting the change in the economic growth outlook. available forecasts from international organisations have also been revised downwards and broadly confirm an outlook of moderate inflation rates in 2010. as in the case of growth, a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounds the inflation projections. risks to these projections are broadly balanced. they relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices.  turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data and estimates provide further evidence of an ongoing deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area. this implies a further reduction in inflationary risks in the medium term.  the further deceleration in underlying monetary dynamics has contrasted with the high month-to-month volatility of developments in m3 and its components which has been observed since the financial turmoil intensified in september 2008. this relates in particular to marketable instruments, but also to the significant substitution that is taking place between different categories of deposits included in m3. while annual m3 growth declined further, to 5.9%, in january 2009, the annual growth rate of the narrow aggregate m1, which includes the most liquid assets, rose to 5.2%.  volatility also characterised the flow of mfi loans to the private sector around the turn of the year, with a monthly contraction in the outstanding amount in december followed by a significantly positive flow in january. however, discounting a possible turn-of-the-year effect and looking beyond these latest developments confirms the decline in the growth of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations observed in 2008. at the same time, it appears that the substantial past reduction in the key ecb interest rates is increasingly being passed through to bank lending rates, indicating that, despite the tensions in financial markets, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is not significantly hampered in the euro area. still, more data and analysis are needed to firmly assess the outlook for credit in the period ahead.  to sum up, inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2% over 2009 and 2010. recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009. over the course of 2010, the economy is expected to gradually recover. at the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing council’s aim of keeping inflation at rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. a cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. after today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, which supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding the fiscal policy responses to the economic downturn, the euro area countries’ updated stability programmes and recent addenda confirm the prospect of a sharp and broad-based deterioration in euro area public finances. a credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions, respecting fully the provisions of the stability and growth pact, is necessary to maintain the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances, which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting long-term growth. in this respect, we support the commission’s intention to initiate excessive deficit procedures for several countries. this is crucial to preserve the credibility of the eu fiscal surveillance framework. it is important that clear deadlines are set for correction of the excessive deficits and that consolidation plans are based on firm and well-specified structural measures.  as regards structural policies, it remains important to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. in this respect, it is essential that government support measures do not distort competition and delay necessary structural adjustment, and it is of the utmost importance to avoid protectionist measures. refraining from protectionism will be key to allowing the global economy to overcome the current crisis more rapidly. the successful completion of the doha round of trade negotiations would also be a milestone towards a more integrated and open world economy for the benefit of all",regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide today reduce

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090205.en.html,5 February 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. as anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 january 2009, the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing an extended period of significant economic downturn, and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing. we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. it is also confirmed by the further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area. fully in line with its primary objective, the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability, that is inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. overall, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. reflecting the impact of the intensified and broadened financial market turmoil, economic activity throughout the world, including in the euro area, has weakened substantially. foreign demand for euro area exports has declined, and domestic factors, notably very low confidence and tight financing conditions, have adversely affected domestic demand. taken together with other available economic data for the euro area, this points to very negative quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth in the last quarter of 2008.  this information is in line with our current analysis and forward-looking assessment. we continue to see persistent weakness in economic activity in the euro area over the coming quarters, as the financial market tensions have a further impact on the global and domestic economy. at the same time, the very substantial fall in commodity prices seen since the middle of 2008 should support real disposable income, and thus consumption, in the period ahead. most recently, there have been tentative signs of stabilisation in some survey data, albeit at historically low levels. these indications, however, require confirmation on a broader basis. in the view of the governing council, the outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. they relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. over time, the euro area should reap the benefit of the effects of significant policy measures that have been decided upon over recent months to deal with the financial turmoil. they should help to restore trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households. in order to ensure that such measures effectively support a sustainable recovery, it is of the utmost importance that they remain focused and temporary in nature so as to maintain a stability-oriented and medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation continued to decline in january 2009, falling to 1.1%, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, from 1.6% in december 2008. while no detailed breakdown for hicp developments in january is available as yet, the decline in headline inflation observed since the middle of 2008 primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period, owing mainly to weak global demand.  looking ahead, lower commodity prices and the prospect of weak demand confirm our assessment of mid-january that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing. owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly reaching very low levels at mid-year. however, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments, inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year. accordingly, it is likely that hicp inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009. such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. looking over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, annual hicp inflation is expected to be in line with price stability. this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term.  regarding risks to price stability over the medium term, unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise, particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. it is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities.  turning to the monetary analysis, the latest evidence confirms a continued deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area, supporting the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing.  in analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil since september 2008 has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly. it has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants, as indicated by recent money and credit data. both the broad aggregate m3 and, in particular, the components of m3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions – such as holdings of money market funds – have shown high month-to-month volatility of late. overall, looking to the extent possible through this volatility, the underlying pace of broad money expansion continues to decelerate gradually from the peak seen in early 2007. however, the intensification of financial tensions since september 2008 is leading to significant substitution among the components of m3.  turning to the evolution of bank credit, the flow of mfi loans to the private sector moderated in the course of 2008, largely on account of weakness in loans to households, especially for house purchase. in december, however, outstanding mfi loans to non-financial corporations contracted for the first time since the onset of the financial turmoil, confirming the significant weakening of corporate credit at the end of the year after a long period of dynamic growth. at the same time, the substantial reduction in key ecb interest rates since october 2008 appears to have been passed through to lower bank lending rates, thereby easing financing conditions for companies and households. moreover, there are some indications that the pace of tightening of bank credit standards is stabilising, albeit at high levels by historical standards. overall, the incoming information on financing conditions requires continuous close monitoring. to sum up, as anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 january 2009, the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing a period of significant economic downturn, and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing. we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. it is also confirmed by a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis, against the background of a further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area. fully in line with its primary objective, the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability, that is inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. this supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. overall, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. turning to fiscal policy, the european commission projects in its january 2009 interim forecast a substantial rise in the average euro area government budget deficit, to 4.0% of gdp this year, from 1.7% in 2008. this rapid deterioration of the fiscal position is broad-based among euro area countries and is due to the economic downturn, additional revenue shortfalls and the fiscal stimulus measures adopted by many governments. in 2009 seven euro area countries are currently expected by the commission to exceed the 3% of gdp reference value for the budget deficit. in addition, many governments have assumed large contingent liabilities in connection with the guarantees provided to banks and will need to finance the capital injections in support of the financial sector. to support the public’s confidence in the sustainability of public finances, it is therefore essential that governments return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible.  as regards structural policies, it is important to continue on the long-term reform path foreseen by the lisbon agenda. at the current juncture, it is essential to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, resisting any protectionist pressure. moreover, product and services market reforms should foster competition and help to speed up effective restructuring. labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. this will be particularly important for those areas and sectors hit strongly by the negative demand shock. in several countries, it is also crucial to take measures with a view to addressing competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years",regular economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2009/html/is090115.en.html,15 January 2009,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by a further 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction since 8 october 2008 to 225 basis points. today’s decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish, owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook. looking forward, we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. after today’s decision we consider risks to price stability over the medium term to be broadly balanced. this takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information, which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil. both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period. monetary expansion is moderating further, supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. all in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. this supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. since september 2008 the financial market turmoil has intensified and broadened. tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector into the real economy. as a result, economic activity throughout the world, including in the euro area, has weakened further. in particular, foreign demand for euro area exports has declined, and euro area domestic activity has contracted in the face of weaker demand prospects and tighter financing conditions. the survey data and monthly indicators for november and december that have become available since our last meeting clearly point to a further weakening of economic activity around the turn of the year, indicating the materialisation of previously identified downside risks to activity.  looking further ahead, on the basis of our current analysis and assessment, we continue to see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the coming quarters as the impact of the financial tensions on activity continues. at the same time, we expect the fall in commodity prices to support real disposable income in the period ahead. furthermore, the euro area should over time reap the full benefit from the effects of policy measures announced over recent weeks  in the view of the governing council, this outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. they relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. it is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery. for this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making, pursuing a stability-oriented and sustainable approach. this is the best way to preserve and enhance confidence. the significant measures being implemented by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should help to ensure trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has declined substantially since the middle of 2008, when it peaked at 4.0%. hicp inflation was 1.6% in december, after 2.1% in november. as we have emphasised on previous occasions, the significant decline in headline inflation in the second half of 2008 reflects mainly the sharp falls in global commodity prices over the past few months.  looking forward, lower commodity prices and weakening demand confirm that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing. owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly reaching very low levels at mid-year. however, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments, inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year. hence it is likely that hicp inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009. such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. looking over the policy-relevant, medium-term horizon, annual hicp inflation is expected to be in line with price stability. this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term.  risks to price stability over the medium term are broadly balanced. unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. it is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities.  turning to the monetary analysis, the latest evidence confirms a moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. in analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-september has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly. recent money and credit data indicate that this has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants. both the broad aggregate m3 and, in particular, the components of m3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions – such as holdings of money market funds – have shown high month-to-month volatility of late. overall, however, looking to the extent possible through this volatility, the rate of broad money growth continues to moderate in line with the trend established over the past 18 months, with the intensification of financial tensions since september leading to significant substitution among the components of m3, rather than, at least so far, sharp changes in the trend of m3 itself.  turning to the evolution of bank loans, the tightening of financing conditions resulting from the intensification of the financial tensions has contributed to a slowdown in the flow of monetary financial institution (mfi) loans to the non-financial private sector in recent months. more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement about the severity and scope of credit constraints and their possible implications for economic activity.  to sum up, we decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by a further 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction since 8 october 2008 to 225 basis points. today’s decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish, owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook. the governing council recalls its operational decision, taken on 18 december 2008, to widen again the corridor formed by the rates on the eurosystem’s standing facilities as of 21 january 2009. looking forward, we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. after today’s decision we consider risks to price stability over the medium-term to be broadly balanced. this takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information, which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil. both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms this view. monetary expansion is moderating further, supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. all in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. this supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. regarding fiscal policies, the governing council welcomes the european council’s reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances. in this respect, the current economic situation calls for particular prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures, taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country. the operation of automatic stabilisers will provide a relatively large and powerful fiscal impulse to the weakening economy, in addition to already announced expansionary fiscal policy measures and the government support for the banking sector. taken together, the additional measures decided so far put a considerable burden on public finances in a large number of euro area countries. if not reversed in due time, this will negatively affect in particular the younger and future generations. it is therefore essential to return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible. the significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in any case not risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances, thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus.  turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy. product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring. labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. the current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition",regular economic monetary_analysis govern decide reduce interest_rate main

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is081204.en.html,4 December 2008,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by a further 75 basis points. this step follows the two 50-basis point reductions in the key ecb interest rates announced on 8 october and 6 november 2008. overall, since our last meeting, the evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further has increased and, looking forward, inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. the decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity. largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil, both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period of time. at the same time, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong, it has continued to decelerate further. all in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. in so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  since september, there has been an intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil. tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy, and the world economy as a whole is feeling their adverse effects. in the euro area, a number of the downside risks to economic activity that were identified previously have materialised, leading in the third quarter to a contraction of 0.2% in real gdp growth, on a quarterly basis, according to eurostat’s first estimate. available survey data and the monthly indicators for october and november suggest that economic activity has weakened further during the fourth quarter of 2008.  looking further ahead, on the basis of our current analysis and assessment, we see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the next few quarters. according to the december 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, a subsequent recovery should then gradually take place, supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken. eurosystem staff project annual real gdp growth of between 0.8% and 1.2% for 2008, between -1.0% and 0.0% for 2009, and between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2010. these figures represent substantial downward revisions relative to the previous ecb staff projections for 2008 and 2009 published in september. forecasts by international organisations have also been revised downwards and are broadly in line with the december 2008 eurosystem staff projections. in the view of the governing council, the economic outlook remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. risks to economic growth lie on the downside. they relate mainly to the potential for a more significant impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. it is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery. for this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making. this is the best way to support confidence. the significant measures announced by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should be implemented swiftly so as to help ensure trust in the financial system and to prevent constraints on credit supply to companies and households.  with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has declined substantially since july. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, hicp inflation was 2.1% in november, after 3.2% in october and 4.0% in july. the significant decline in headline inflation since the summer mainly reflects the considerable easing in global commodity prices over the past few months, which more than offsets the impact of the sharp rise in unit labour costs in the first half of this year.  looking forward, lower commodity prices and weakening demand lead us to conclude that inflationary pressures are diminishing further. the annual hicp inflation rate is expected to continue to decline in the coming months and to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. depending primarily on future developments in oil and other commodity prices, a faster decline in hicp inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year, mainly due to base effects. however, also due to base effects, inflation rates could increase again in the second half of the year, so that any sharp fall in hicp inflation should be short-lived and is therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective.  consistent with this assessment, the december 2008 eurosystem staff projections foresee annual hicp inflation of between 3.2% and 3.4% for 2008 and declining to between 1.1% and 1.7% for 2009. for 2010, hicp inflation is projected to lie between 1.5% and 2.1%. the hicp inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards substantially in relation to the september 2008 ecb staff projections, reflecting mainly the large declines in commodity prices and the impact of weakening demand on price developments. in this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for short and long-term interest rates, as well as futures prices for oil and non-energy commodities. in addition, the projections are based on the expectation of a decline in wage pressure over the projection horizon. forecasts from international organisations give a broadly similar picture. looking through the shorter-term volatility in headline hicp inflation rates, risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are more balanced than in the past. unexpected further declines in commodity prices could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. it is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities.  turning to the monetary analysis, various estimates of underlying broad money growth point to a sustained but moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing further, with some risks remaining on the upside in the medium to longer term. it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-september marks a potential watershed in the evolution of monetary developments. the most recent money and credit data indicate that this intensification has had a significant impact on the behaviour of market participants. thus far, such developments have largely taken the form of substitution among components of the broad aggregate m3, rather than sharp changes in the evolution of m3 itself.  the latest available data, namely up to the end of october, reveal a continued moderation of the growth rate of loans to the non-financial private sector. at the same time, for the euro area as a whole, there were no significant indications of a drying up in the availability of loans. the annual growth rate of loans to households also moderated further, in line with the weakening of economic and housing market prospects and tighter financing conditions. the data do signal an impact of the intensification of the financial turmoil on bank behaviour. looking forward, more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement. to sum up, there is increased evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further and inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. the decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity largely related to the global effects of the financial turmoil. a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports this view. while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong, it has continued to decelerate further. hence, when considering all available information and analysis, the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by a further 75 basis points. all in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. in so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. regarding fiscal policies, the governing council considers it crucial that discipline and a medium-term perspective are maintained, taking fully into account the consequences of any shorter-term action on fiscal sustainability. it is of the utmost importance that the public’s confidence in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved, with the rules-based eu fiscal framework being fully applied and its integrity being fully preserved. the provisions of the treaty of nice and the stability and growth pact require a medium-term perspective and allow for the necessary flexibility. automatic fiscal stabilisers are relatively large in the euro area and provide a powerful source of fiscal support to a weakening economy. where room for manoeuvre exists, additional budgetary measures could be effective if they are timely, targeted and temporary.  turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy. product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring. labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. the current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is081106.en.html,6 November 2008,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates further by 50 basis points, following the previous coordinated interest rate cut on 8 october 2008. the outlook for price stability has improved further. inflation rates are expected to continue to decline in the coming months, reaching a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009. the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time. in such an environment, taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. at the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration. all in all, the information available and our current analysis indicate a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, even though they have not disappeared completely. at this juncture, it is therefore crucial that all parties, including public authorities, price-setters and social partners, fully live up to their responsibilities. the level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead. we expect the banking sector to make its contribution to restore confidence. the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. in so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  when analysing current developments in economic activity, we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty in large part stemming from the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil. the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects, as tensions increasingly spill over from the financial sector to the real economy and from advanced economies to emerging market economies. in the case of the euro area, the latest survey data confirm that momentum in economic activity has weakened significantly, with sluggish domestic and external demand and tighter financing conditions. looking forward, it will be crucial to lay sound foundations for a recovery. for this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making, and to avoid second-round effects. it is equally important that the banking sector takes fully into account the significant support measures adopted by governments to deal with the financial turmoil. these measures should be supporting trust in the financial system and should help to prevent undue constraints in credit supply to companies and households. in combination with the recent broad-based falls in commodity prices, these measures should help to restore confidence.  in the view of the governing council, a number of the downside risks to economic activity identified earlier have materialised, particularly those stemming from the financial market tensions. other downside risks continue to relate to disorderly developments due to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures, as well as to the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn. however, it has been steadily declining since july, falling – according to eurostat’s flash estimate – to 3.2% in october, from 3.6% in september and 3.8% in august. the continued high level of inflation is largely due to both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. moreover, strong wage growth in the first half of the year, in spite of a weaker growth momentum, combined with a deceleration in labour productivity during the same period, resulted in a significant increase in unit labour cost.  looking forward, recent sharp falls in commodity prices, as well as the ongoing weakening in demand, suggest that the annual hicp inflation rate will continue to decline in the coming months and reach a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009. depending, in particular, on the future path of oil and other commodity prices, some even stronger downside movements in hicp inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year, particularly due to base effects. these movements would be short-lived and therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. looking through such volatility, however, upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are alleviating. the remaining upside risks relate to an unexpected increase in commodity prices, as well as in indirect taxes and administered prices, and the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour, particularly in economies where nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. the governing council calls for these schemes to be abolished. it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rates of broad money and credit aggregates, while still remaining strong, continued to decline in september. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, monetary data up to september confirm that upside risks to price stability are diminishing but that they have not disappeared completely.  a closer examination of the money and credit data indicates that the recent intensification of financial tensions has already had an identifiable impact, particularly in the form of outflows from money market funds and greater inflows into overnight deposits. however, the full impact of investors’ uncertainty on their portfolio allocation behaviour is still to be seen in the coming months. both portfolio shifts between non–monetary and monetary assets and shifts between different types of monetary assets can therefore not be ruled out in the period ahead. hence, such effects will need to be taken into account when assessing monetary growth and its implications for price stability over the medium term.  there is also some evidence in the september data that the recent intensification of the financial tensions has triggered a slower provision of bank credit to euro area residents, mostly taking the form of smaller holdings of securities. at the same time, for the euro area as a whole, up to september there were no indications of a drying-up in the availability of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations. in particular, the maturity composition of loans suggests that non-financial corporations continued to obtain funding, also at relatively long maturities. however, more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement. to sum up, the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time. in such an environment, taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. at the same time, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration. hence, when taking all information and analysis into account, there is a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, even though they have not disappeared completely. at this juncture, it is therefore crucial that all parties, including public authorities, price-setters and social partners, fully live up to their responsibilities. the level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead. we expect the banking sector to make its contribution to restore confidence. the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. in so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  in the area of fiscal policy, medium-term challenges, such as population ageing, strongly underline the need for fiscal policy to focus on medium-term sustainability and thereby build confidence. accordingly, and as recently confirmed by the ecofin council and the european council, the fiscal policy provisions of the maastricht treaty and the stability and growth pact should continue to be applied fully. the fiscal rules are one of the indispensable pillars of emu and the single currency, which must remain firmly in place so as not to undermine the confidence in fiscal sustainability. finally, the current situation calls for ensuring the high quality and timeliness of statistical information on government interventions to ensure the transparent and accountable use of public funds.  turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook will require a significant degree of resilience from the euro area economy. the current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms so that countries may fully exploit the benefits offered by the enhancement of international trade and market integration, in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition",regular economic monetary_analysis today meet govern decide reduce

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is081002.en.html,2 October 2008,"on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation, recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments. in this context, we stressed the crucial importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective. price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources, contains inflation risk premia and longer-term financing costs, and preserves the purchasing power of our currency. in so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. at the same time, annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time. with the weakening of demand, upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. while the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation. it is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. all parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities accordingly, we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  when analysing current developments in economic activity, it needs to be stressed that we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty, in large part stemming from the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil. this complicates any assessment of the near to medium-term economic prospects. as the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financial market turmoil, the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. the fall in oil prices from their peak in july and ongoing growth in emerging market economies might support a gradual recovery in the course of 2009.  in the view of the governing council, the economic outlook is subject to increased downside risks, mainly stemming from a scenario of ongoing financial market tensions affecting the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen. other downside risks relate to the possibility of renewed increases in highly volatile energy and food prices, disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, standing at 3.6% in september according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 3.8% in august. this still worrying level of inflation is largely the consequence of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. moreover, wage growth has been picking up rather strongly in recent quarters, in spite of a weaker growth momentum and at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated. this resulted in a sharp increase in the year-on-year unit labour cost – to 3.4% – in the second quarter of this year, after several years of more moderate increases in the order of 1-1½%.  looking ahead, on the basis of current commodity futures prices, annual hicp inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time, moderating gradually during the course of 2009. at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, taking into account the weakening in demand, upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. they include the possibility of previous commodity price rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices, as well as a renewed increase in commodity prices. in particular, there is a very strong concern that the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures. moreover, unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices could occur.  against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. this is all the more the case in an environment of very high uncertainty. broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of past energy and food price increases on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. the governing council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. we have repeatedly expressed our concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council calls for these schemes to be abolished. turning to the monetary analysis, we need to recognise that the latest monetary data refer to the end of august and thus do not yet embody the impact of the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil. further data on this impact will be carefully evaluated. as a general observation, previous episodes suggest that financial market tensions can have a relatively limited impact on monetary developments, but they have also been associated with large portfolio shifts and thus have exerted significant influence on monetary data.  while the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, data up to august show that the growth of broad money and credit aggregates moderated over the past few months, reflecting the monetary policy decisions taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability. as a more detailed examination shows, the flat yield curve and the structure of bank deposit rates have led to a number of substitution effects. first, there has been a substitution from longer-term maturity assets into instruments covered by m3, which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk. as a consequence, the annual growth rate of m3 probably overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion. second, there have been substitution effects within m3. in contrast to the dynamic developments in m3, annual m1 growth has fallen to very low levels. this reflects relatively attractive interest rates for time deposits, which have increased the opportunity cost of holding cash or overnight deposits.  although, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions, the gradual moderation of growth in loans continued in the august data, as previously anticipated, with corporate demand for credit slowing. at the same time, the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area.  to sum up, we discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation, recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments. in this context, we stressed how crucial it is for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective. price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources, contains inflation risk premia and longer-term financing costs, and preserves the purchasing power of our currency. in so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. the cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time and, when taking into account the weakening of demand, that upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. while the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation. it is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. all parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities accordingly, we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding fiscal policy, in the current situation of continuing economic uncertainty, it is essential that governments abide by the rules of the stability and growth pact and ensure the sustainability of public finances. maintaining sound public finances will enable governments to let automatic stabilisers operate freely and thus contribute to smoothing the economic cycle and to supporting private sector confidence. turning to structural policies, measures that foster competition and flexibility and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances. while moderate unit labour cost growth is crucial in all euro area countries, it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise. moreover, labour market reforms fostering employment and investment and promoting skills, innovation and efficiency remain essential to support growth and real incomes in the longer term",regular

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080904.en.html,4 September 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting we decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since the last meeting has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail. while the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term. the latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real gdp growth in mid-2008. this reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors, including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices. in this environment, it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment. on the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  according to eurostat’s first estimate, following strong quarterly growth of 0.7% in the first quarter, euro area real gdp contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2008. in terms of quarter-on-quarter growth, private consumption declined by 0.2% and there was a perceptible weakness in investment, which fell by 1.2%. growth in both euro area imports and exports declined by 0.4%. taking into account all available information, the euro area economy is currently experiencing an episode of weak activity characterised by high commodity prices weighing on consumer confidence and demand, as well as by dampened investment growth. we expect this episode to be followed by a gradual recovery. in particular, if persistent, the fall in oil prices from their peak in july will help strengthen real disposable income, with the level of employment remaining high and the unemployment rate low by historical standards. moreover, growth in the world economy is expected to remain relatively resilient, benefiting mainly from sustained growth in emerging economies. this should support external demand for euro area goods and services and thereby investment.  this outlook is also reflected in the september 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. the exercise projects average annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.1% and 1.7% in 2008, and between 0.6% and 1.8% in 2009. in comparison with the june eurosystem staff projections, real gdp growth figures for 2008 and 2009 are lower.  in the view of the governing council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity is particularly high at the current juncture and, generally, downside risks prevail. risks stem particularly from renewed increases in energy and food prices, which could dampen consumption and investment. moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen. the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, as do concerns about rising protectionist pressures. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, standing at 3.8% in august according to eurostat’s flash estimate, after 4.0% in june and july 2008. this worrying level of inflation is largely the result of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. moreover, wage growth has been picking up in recent quarters, at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated, resulting in sharp increases in unit labour costs.  looking ahead, on the basis of current commodity futures prices, the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for quite some time, moderating only gradually during the course of 2009. consistent with this view, the september ecb staff projections foresee average annual hicp inflation at between 3.4% and 3.6% in 2008, and between 2.3% and 2.9% in 2009. the higher inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect higher energy prices and, to a lesser extent, higher food and services prices than assumed previously.  in this context, it is important to recall the conditional nature of the ecb staff projections. they are based on a number of assumptions that are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. in particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates reflect market expectations as at mid-august. moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that oil and non-oil commodity prices, while remaining at elevated levels, will exhibit greater stability over the projection horizon than has been the case in recent months, in line with prevailing futures prices.  it is the governing council’s view that, at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, there are upside risks to the outlook for price developments. these risks include the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices and of previous rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices. there is particularly a very strong concern that the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures. moreover, the upside risks to price stability could be aggravated by unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices.  against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage‑setting behaviour must be avoided. the governing council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. all parties concerned – in both the private and the public sectors – must meet their responsibilities in this regard. the governing council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council calls for these schemes to be abolished. the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. in line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. while the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability, the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term.  the currently flat yield curve has given rise to a substitution from longer maturity assets into monetary instruments, which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk. this substitution has led the current headline rate of m3 growth to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion. at the same time, shifts out of overnight deposits drove the annual growth rate of m1 down further in july. these effects, as well as other temporary factors, must be taken into account when assessing monetary developments and their implications. a broad-based analysis of the data, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and allowing for these considerations, confirms the underlying strength of money growth.  in particular, the pace, maturity and sectoral composition of borrowing from banks suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions. this notwithstanding, growth in loans now shows signs of moderation, as previously anticipated, with corporate demand for credit slowing. at the same time, the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. the information that has become available since the last meeting of the governing council has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time. the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, but the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term. the latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real gdp growth in mid-2008. this reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors, including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices. against this background, it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. on the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding fiscal policy, budget plans for 2009 should fully reflect existing policy commitments. this implies that euro area countries with relatively large fiscal deficits need to specify much more ambitious and concrete consolidation measures, especially on the expenditure side. countries that have already achieved their medium-term budgetary objectives need to ensure that they maintain sound structural fiscal positions. at the current juncture, the steady pursuit of stability-oriented fiscal policies would help to contain inflationary pressures and provide the required budgetary room for manoeuvre to allow automatic stabilisers to contribute to smoothing the business cycle. turning to structural policies, measures that reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances. while this is crucial in all euro area countries, it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise. moreover, fostering productivity through enhanced investment in innovation and education enlarges the scope for increases in real incomes in the longer run",regular economic monetary_analysis today decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available confirm annual inflation rate likely remain level consistent price stability protract

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080807.en.html,7 August 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in july. it has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. this assessment is underpinned by continued vigorous money growth, with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply. in such a context, it remains crucial to avoid broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. the latest economic data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid-2008, which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter. against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment. on the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  the information on economic activity that has become available since the july press conference suggests that real gdp growth figures for mid-2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year. as indicated on previous occasions, this represents partly a technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first months of the year. in addition, it also partly reflects a weakening in gdp growth due to factors such as slower expansion at the global level and dampening effects from high and volatile oil and food prices. in order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns, it is necessary to look through the volatility in quarter-on-quarter growth rates and monthly indicators.  taking this perspective, growth in the world economy, while moderating, is expected to remain relatively resilient, benefiting in particular from sustained growth in emerging economies. this should support external demand for euro area goods and services. as regards domestic developments, in a medium-term perspective the fundamentals of the euro area are sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. investment growth in the euro area has provided ongoing, though moderating, support to economic activity. moreover, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly, and unemployment rates remain low in historical terms. however, these developments, which support household disposable income and consumption, are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices.  in the view of the governing council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high, owing to, among other things, the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets. overall, downside risks prevail. in particular, risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently anticipated. the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, as do concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures. in this respect, the failure of the recent negotiations in the context of the world trade organization’s doha round on trade liberalisation is a major setback. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, reaching 4.0% in june 2008 and, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, 4.1% in july. this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level. at the same time, while labour productivity growth has decelerated, there are some indications that labour cost growth has been rising in recent quarters. looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent with price stability for quite some time, moderating only gradually in 2009.  risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months. these risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices and of increasing indirect effects on consumer prices. there is a very strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second-round effects. the governing council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. furthermore, there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. the shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodity-importing countries to commodity-exporting countries require a change in the behaviour of companies and households. therefore, broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. all parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities in this regard. in this context, the governing council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. in line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. while the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, also reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address upside risks to price stability, the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term.  the current yield curve has led to very rapid increases in time deposits and to a substantial decline in annual m1 growth. such effects and other temporary factors must be taken into account in assessing monetary developments. overall, a broad-based analysis of the data, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, confirms the underlying strength of money growth. one of the main factors leading to this conclusion is the still high growth of mfi loans to the private sector, which is underpinning the robust nature of monetary growth. the pace, maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions. higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area have dampened the growth of household borrowing over the past few years. by contrast, and notwithstanding tighter financing conditions and moderating economic growth, the expansion of bank credit to non-financial corporations thus far remains very robust.  to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability, and monetary aggregates continue to grow vigorously, with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply. the latest economic data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid-2008, which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter. against this background, it remains crucial to avoid broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. on the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.  regarding fiscal policy, there are risks that some countries will not achieve their fiscal targets this year. in this situation a rigorous implementation of budget plans and the avoidance of expenditure slippage are of crucial importance. budget plans for 2009, which are currently being finalised in a number of countries, need to reflect european commitments. in particular, countries with still large deficits must provide ambitious and concrete deficit reduction plans, backed by clearly specified measures, preferably on the expenditure side. where budgetary scope is available, automatic stabilisers can contribute to the smoothing of cyclical economic fluctuations. as regards structural policies, measures which reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance, particularly in the current climate of high inflation and slowing real gdp growth. these include the removal of impediments to competition in the services sector in general, and at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors, as well as in the energy sector, more specifically. equally, making labour markets more flexible and enhancing investment in education and training would foster productivity, thereby increasing the scope for increases in real incomes",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available previous underpin reasoning decision increase interest_rate confirm

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080703.en.html,3 July 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision was taken to prevent broadly based second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. hicp inflation rates have continued to rise significantly since the autumn of last year. they are expected to remain well above the level consistent with price stability for a more protracted period than previously thought. moreover, continued very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply in a context of ongoing financial market tensions confirm our assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. at the same time, while the latest data confirm the expected weakening of real gdp growth in mid-2008 after exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and continue to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. on the basis of our current assessment, the monetary policy stance following today’s decision will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. information that has become available since the june press conference confirms our previous expectation of rather weak real gdp growth in the second quarter of 2008, in part as a technical counter-reaction to the strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8% in the first quarter. as we have stressed previously, the quarterly growth rates for the first half of this year have been subject to strong temporary and compensatory factors, notably weather-related effects on the profile of construction activity. therefore, in order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns, it is necessary to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together. interpreted on this basis, the information available remains broadly in line with our expectation of moderate ongoing growth.  looking ahead, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. while moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies. this should support euro area external demand. as regards domestic developments, the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. in this context, investment growth in the euro area should continue to support economic activity, as rates of capacity utilisation remain elevated and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. moreover, employment rates and labour force participation have increased significantly in recent years, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. however, these developments, which support household disposable income and consumption, are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices.  in the view of the governing council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high, owing not least to the very high levels of commodity prices, and downside risks prevail. in particular, risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the ongoing financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than anticipated. concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also imply downside risks to the outlook for economic activity. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained well above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, reaching 3.7% in may 2008 and – according to eurostat’s flash estimate – 4.0% in june. this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months.  looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain well above 2% for quite some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. we are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation, which is likely to be more persistent than anticipated some months ago.  risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased further over the past few months. these risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices. there is also a very strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second-round effects. the governing council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. furthermore, there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. the shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodity-importing countries to commodity-exporting countries have to be accepted. they require a change in the behaviour of companies and households. therefore, broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. all parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities in this regard. in this context, the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. in line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. against this background, the continued strength of monetary dynamics represents an important signal of the risks to price stability over the medium term that we have been addressing through our actions since end-2005, including today’s move. more specifically, annual m3 growth has remained very vigorous in recent months, supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector. although annual m3 growth of still above 10% overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion, owing to the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. the current structure of yields has triggered substitution both within and into the broad monetary aggregate m3, leading to a pronounced decline in annual m1 growth and very rapid increases in time deposits. at the same time, higher short-term interest rates have served to moderate the growth of household borrowing, although cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area have also played a substantial role in this regard. however, the growth of bank loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust despite the rises in short-term rates. while some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and more moderate economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.2% in may 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong.  not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. moreover, a thorough assessment of the money and credit data has provided an important insight into bank behaviour and financing conditions. in particular, the strength, maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the tensions. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply. at the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate ongoing real gdp growth when the high volatility of growth rates in the first half of this year is taken properly into account. against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, it is imperative that we prevent broadly based second-round effects and counteract the increasing risks to price stability. we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. on the basis of our current assessment, the monetary policy stance following today’s decision will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. regarding fiscal policy, budgetary consolidation targets are at risk in a number of euro area countries. moreover, the risk of countries’ budget deficits coming close to or even exceeding the 3% of gdp reference value has increased. the governing council therefore reiterates its strong support for a rigorous implementation of euro area governments’ 2008 budgets and a prudent design of fiscal policy plans for 2009, in line with the agreement in the eurogroup in may 2008. achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is essential to ensure the sustainability of public finances as well as to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and thereby contribute to the smoothing of cyclical fluctuations.  as regards structural reforms, we reiterate our full support for all efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. in view of the marked increase in international food commodity prices, removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit european consumers through lower prices. as regards labour markets, let me direct your attention to the ecb’s 2008 structural issues report, which was recently submitted to the european parliament. it emphasises the generally favourable labour market developments in the euro area over the last decade but equally points out the urgent need to counter the ageing-related reduction in the labour force, in particular by increasing employment in all groups of society, by making labour markets more flexible and by enhancing investment in education and training",regular economic monetary_analysis decide

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080605.en.html,5 June 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. at the same time, we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further. inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn of last year, owing mainly to strong increases in energy and food prices. hicp inflation is now expected to remain high for a more protracted period than previously thought. upside risks to price stability over the medium term are also confirmed by the continuing very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now. at the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. the governing council is monitoring very closely all developments. it is in a state of heightened alertness. by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. it is our strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8%, real gdp growth in the first quarter of 2008 was well above expectations. in part, this strength reflected temporary factors, notably the unusually mild winter in many parts of europe, which appears to have boosted construction activity. however, the high growth rate in the first quarter might be partly offset in the second. it is therefore more appropriate, in order to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly results, to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together.  in line with available forecasts, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. while moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies. this should support euro area external demand. the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound, and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. against this background, we expect investment growth in the euro area to provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. moreover, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. these developments support disposable income, although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices.  this outlook is also reflected in the june 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2008 and between 1.0% and 2.0% in 2009. in comparison with the march ecb staff projections, the current range projected for real gdp growth in 2008 is within the upper part of the range published in march 2008, mainly as a consequence of the better than expected outcome in the first quarter. for 2009, the range has been adjusted downwards, following the increase in commodity prices over recent months. the year-on-year growth rates which i have just mentioned need to be interpreted with particular caution on this occasion. while the annual rates suggest that growth may be weaker in 2009 than in 2008, they mask the fact that on a quarterly basis real gdp growth is projected to reach a trough in 2008, before gradually recovering thereafter. in order not to draw the wrong conclusions about the growth dynamics implied in the staff projections it is important to keep this distinction in mind.  in the governing council’s view, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. in particular, risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than anticipated. moreover, downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. risks also arise from concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained above 3% for the past seven months. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it was 3.6% in may 2008. this confirms the more persistent current upward pressures on euro area inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months.  looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain above 3% for some time to come, before moderating only gradually in 2009. we are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation, which is likely to be more persistent than previously anticipated.  consistent with this view, the eurosystem staff projections foresee average annual hicp inflation at between 3.2% and 3.6% in 2008 and between 1.8% and 3.0% in 2009. compared with the march 2008 ecb staff projections, the ranges projected for inflation in 2008 and 2009 are markedly higher, reflecting mainly higher oil and food prices and increasingly inflationary pressures in the services sector.  in this context, it is important to recall the conditional nature of the eurosystem staff projections. they are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. in particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-may. moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that the recent dynamism in oil and non-oil commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices. a further crucial assumption is that there will be no broad-based second-round effects on wages.  in the governing council’s view, at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon risks to the outlook for prices remain clearly on the upside and have increased further these risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. it is also a strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. the pricing power of firms, particularly in market segments with low competition, such as parts of the services sector, may prove stronger than currently expected. moreover, higher than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations and price-setting behaviour in the euro area with particular attention. against this background, it is imperative to secure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. all parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities. wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. in this context, the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. annual m3 growth remained very vigorous in april, supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector. while the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual m3 growth continues to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. annual m1 growth has continued to moderate in recent months, reflecting higher short-term interest rates which have encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits. the moderation in the growth of household borrowing also reflects the dampening impact of higher short-term interest rates, as well as cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. however, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. while some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.9% in april 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong.  the monetary analysis has helped to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy in the face of the ongoing financial turmoil. from this perspective, the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability at longer horizons. moreover, a thorough assessment of the monetary counterparts suggests that, as yet, the availability of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations has not been significantly affected by the turmoil. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now. in fact, we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further. the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth. against this background, the governing council is monitoring very closely all developments. it is in a state of heightened alertness. by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. securing a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is of the essence. regarding fiscal policy, the governing council welcomes the spring 2008 orientations for euro area fiscal policies agreed by the eurogroup ministers on 13 may 2008. many euro area governments still need to implement much more ambitious policies to ensure that their country-specific medium-term budgetary objectives are attained by 2010 at the latest, as agreed in berlin in april 2007. achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is imperative to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and will help to prepare for the budgetary costs of population ageing. the steady pursuit of prudent and efficient fiscal policies would also help to limit current inflationary pressures and would increase potential growth and employment.  as regards structural reforms, the governing council reiterates its full support for all efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit european consumers through lower prices. the ongoing “health check” of the eu common agricultural policy is welcomed, as are the efforts to limit upward pressure on agricultural prices through biofuels policies. a successful conclusion of the doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in europe and worldwide in particular. tax policies are not an appropriate means to counter commodity price increases, be it oil or non-oil commodities, as this would send wrong signals to producers and consumers alike and would distort markets",regular

interest rates unchanged. inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn, owing mainly to increases in energy and food prices. as we have said on previous occasions, inflation rates are expected to remain high for a rather protracted period of time, before gradually declining again. the latest information confirms our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the

to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth. however, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions still persist. against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority. the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  the latest data and survey information on economic activity confirm previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first half of 2008. in particular, industrial production data for the first months of the year showed resilience, while economic sentiment generally continued to soften. overall, the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances.  in line with available forecasts, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. while moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies. this should continue to support euro area external demand. meanwhile, investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. at the same time, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. this supports real disposable income and thus consumption growth, although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices.  the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. in particular, risks relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than previously anticipated. moreover, downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. risks also arise from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. with regard to price developments, annual hicp inflation has remained above 3% for the past six months. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, it was 3.3% in april 2008. this outturn confirms the ongoing strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months.  looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, moderating only gradually over the course of 2008. accordingly, we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of high annual rates of inflation. in order to ensure that current high inflation rates remain temporary, it is imperative that they do not become entrenched in longer-term expectations or lead to broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside. these risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. most importantly, there is a risk that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. in particular, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, may prove stronger than currently expected. moreover, higher than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects owing to the high level of current inflation rates. against this background, it is imperative that all the parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, meet their responsibilities. wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. in this context, the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. in the view of the governing council, continued responsible wage agreements are of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. annual m3 growth remained very vigorous at 10.3% in march, supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector. at the same time, annual m1 growth continued to moderate in march, reflecting higher short-term interest rates which encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits. while the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual m3 growth currently overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. however, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. while some future moderation can be expected in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 15.0% in the year to march 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong.  for the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the development of broad money and loans. continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the availability of bank credit to euro area firms has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans. the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth. however, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. against this background, we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council. we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. regarding fiscal policies, the latest forecast by the european commission points to a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008, followed by a further small increase in 2009. this deterioration in part reflects a less favourable economic environment and a likely reversal of windfall revenues accrued in past years. however, it also reflects a standstill in fiscal consolidation and new deficit-increasing measures in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, including some with high deficits. for several countries, the attainment of the country-specific medium-term objectives by 2010 at the latest, which is the commitment made by euro area governments in berlin in april 2007, is clearly at risk. in these countries, much more ambitious policies are imperative. for all countries, prudent fiscal policies would also help to counteract current inflationary pressures. at the current juncture, it is also important to reinforce the structural reform agenda, in particular with a view to fostering market integration and to reducing rigidities in product and labour markets. policy initiatives aimed at enhancing competition in market segments with low competition, such as services and energy, would allow pricing behaviour to adjust and thus contribute to lower inflation pressures. furthermore, policies to increase trend productivity growth would contribute to smaller unit labour cost increases and ultimately also to higher employment",regular economic

quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4%, following 0.7% in the previous quarter. the latest information on economic activity also underpins previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first quarter of 2008. overall, the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances. looking ahead, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. while moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies. this should continue to support euro area external demand. meanwhile, investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation is high, profitability has been sustained and there are no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans. at the same time, as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. while being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices on purchasing power, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income growth.  the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. the risks relate mainly to the financial market turbulence, which could last longer than initially thought and could have a broader than currently expected impact on the real economy. moreover, downside risks also stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices, as well as from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual hicp inflation rate was 3.5% in march 2008, after 3.3% in february. this outturn confirms the ongoing strong and lately further increasing short-term upward pressure on inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices in recent months. looking ahead, the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, moderating only gradually over the course of 2008. accordingly, we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation. the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside. these risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. most importantly, there is a risk that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. in particular, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, may prove stronger than currently expected, and stronger than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions.  against this background, it is imperative that all the parties concerned meet their responsibilities. second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wage and price-setting behaviour must be avoided. in the view of the governing council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. in this context, the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. annual m3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.3% in february, supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector. while annual m1 growth has moderated further in recent months, as higher short-term interest rates have increased the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of m3, the growth of time deposits remains extremely strong. this reflects the relatively flat yield curve, which has made it more attractive to hold monetary assets remunerated at close to market rates than to hold riskier, longer-maturity instruments. overall, the impact of the flat yield curve and a number of other temporary factors suggest that annual m3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion. however, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. however, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.8% in the year to february 2008. overall, bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11% on an annual basis for the past two years. for the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans to households and non-financial corporations. the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth. however, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected. against this background, we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council. we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. regarding fiscal policies, the intentions reflected in the latest round of stability programmes imply a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008. further fiscal pressures are likely to arise as overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions are already being revised downwards and political demands for fiscal loosening are increasing. in this situation, countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with structural consolidation, in line with the requirements of the stability and growth pact. at the current juncture, particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies would also contribute to containing inflationary pressures. turning to structural reforms, we welcome the launch of the 2008-10 cycle of the renewed lisbon strategy for growth and jobs by the european council. the favourable labour market trends in the euro area suggest that economic reforms are paying off. however, many challenges remain as overall employment is still below the lisbon target of 70% and unemployment is still unacceptably high. moreover, productivity growth remains weak, constraining general income growth. therefore, we strongly encourage euro area countries to increase reform efforts, in particular to foster market integration and to reduce rigidities in product and labour markets that restrict competition, employment flexibility and wage differentiation, and we support them in these efforts. they would not only promote employment and support potential growth, but would also contribute to moderating price pressures",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged late information confirm existence strong short term upward

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080306.en.html,6 March 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation. it has also confirmed the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real gdp growth. yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. indeed, the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council. we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  the latest information on economic activity confirms the picture of moderating growth around the turn of the year. according to eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4%, following 0.8% in the previous quarter. surveys of business and consumer confidence, which have followed a downward trend since the summer of 2007, overall remain consistent with ongoing growth. looking ahead, in 2008 both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area, albeit at lower rates than during 2007. the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area economy does not suffer from major imbalances. while being dampened by the global slowdown, investment growth should provide ongoing support, as capacity utilisation is high and profitability has been sustained. at the same time, as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. while being dampened by higher commodity prices, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with rising employment.  these factors are also reflected in the march 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projections. annual real gdp growth is projected to lie in the range of 1.3% to 2.1% in 2008, and to be between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2009. in comparison with the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards, reflecting weaker global demand, stronger pressure from commodity prices and less favourable financing conditions than were foreseen in december. available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook. in the view of the governing council, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains unusually high. downside risks to the outlook for economic activity continue to exist. they relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments. further downside risks stem from the scope for additional commodity price rises, protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s first estimate, the annual hicp inflation rate was 3.2% in february 2008, unchanged from january. this confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from the increases in energy and food prices in recent months. looking ahead, we expect a more protracted period of relatively high rates of inflation than we did a few months ago. the annual hicp inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and moderate only gradually later in the year.  the march 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual hicp inflation of between 2.6% and 3.2% in 2008, and between 1.5% and 2.7% in 2009. compared with the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projected ranges for hicp inflation have shifted upwards, mainly reflecting significant additional increases in food and energy prices.  it is important to recall that these staff projections are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. in particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-february.  moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumptions that the recent dynamism in commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices, and that pressure from labour costs and profit margins will be limited. in the view of the governing council, the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term are on the upside. these risks include further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months. furthermore, they include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. moreover, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, could be stronger than expected. increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far also pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. at this juncture, it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on price-setting, on the one hand, and on wages, on the other hand, stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. in the view of the governing council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. in this context, the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. annual m3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.5% in january, supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector. a number of temporary factors suggest that m3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion. the relatively flat yield curve in particular has made holding monetary assets more attractive. however, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. however, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.6% in the year to january 2008. overall, bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11% on an annual basis for the past two years. for the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august 2007 strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates up to january 2008. in addition, according to the available data, the turmoil has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets, as were observed between 2001 and 2003. notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real gdp growth. yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council. we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. regarding fiscal policies, the governing council welcomes the fact that the berlin eurogroup agreement of april 2007, including the consolidation targets, was confirmed in the ecofin council’s opinions on the latest stability programme updates. there is no justification for delaying structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining fiscal imbalances. on the contrary, the challenges ahead call for particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies to support private sector confidence. achieving and maintaining sound fiscal positions will also allow the free operation of automatic stabilisers and contribute to the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union.  structural reforms would not only be beneficial for employment and potential growth, but would also help to reduce inflationary pressures. enhancing competition, especially in services and network industries, is essential at this juncture to support price stability and enhance productivity growth. similarly, administered prices, indirect taxes, minimum wage legislation and public sector wage-setting should not add to inflationary pressures in the economy",regular economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080207.en.html,7 February 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. this decision reflects our assessment that risks to price stability over the medium term are on the upside, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. the current short-term upward pressure on inflation must not spill over to the medium term. the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium and long term is of the highest priority to the governing council, reflecting its mandate. against this background, the governing council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. as the reappraisal of risk in financial markets continues, there remains unusually high uncertainty about its overall impact on the real economy. while the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  the latest information on economic activity around the turn of the year points to a more moderate pace of growth in the euro area than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007. this assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which, while having declined over the past few months, overall remain consistent with ongoing growth.  looking ahead, while the slowdown in the economies of some of the euro area’s major trading partners is likely to have an impact on euro area real gdp growth in 2008, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing growth. this assessment is broadly in line with available forecasts from private and public-sector sources. the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound. the euro area economy does not have major imbalances profitability has been sustained and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, the number of people employed and labour force participation have increased significantly. consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income, and investment growth should provide ongoing support.  that said, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth is unusually high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity have been confirmed to lie on the downside. risks relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with negative effects on world and euro area growth. further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate the annual hicp inflation rate was 3.2% in january 2008, compared with 3.1% in december 2007. this confirms the continued strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from strong increases in commodity prices, in particular oil and food prices, in recent months.  looking ahead, the annual hicp inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and moderate only gradually in the further course of 2008. this confirms our expectation of a protracted period of temporarily high rates of inflation. moreover, it is important to stress that the moderation in the rate of inflation which is embedded in the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections is based on the assumption that the recent rises in commodity prices will be partly reversed, in line with futures prices. more fundamentally, the projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on hicp inflation do not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour.  risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are confirmed to lie on the upside. these risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. furthermore, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, could be stronger than expected. at this juncture, it is therefore imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. in the view of the governing council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. indexation of nominal wages to the consumer price index should be avoided. finally, further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. annual m3 growth, although declining somewhat in december, remained very vigorous at 11.5%, whereas m1 growth continues to moderate, reflecting the dampening impact of higher interest rates. broad money dynamics in recent quarters are likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, notably the flattening of the yield curve, which may have supported some substitution into monetary assets. overall, taking these special factors into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. this conclusion is supported by the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.1% in december. although the growth of household borrowing has moderated further over the past few quarters, reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations was 14.4% higher at the end of december 2007 than a year earlier. for the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. in particular, according to the available data, increased financial market volatility has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets, as was the case between 2001 and 2003. notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth suggests that the supply of bank credit in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. the impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on the real economy is still surrounded by unusually high uncertainty. incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments. the governing council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. it is paramount that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the governing council.  with respect to fiscal policies, a discretionary fiscal loosening in eu countries should be avoided. there is ample evidence that activist fiscal policies were not effective in stabilising european economies but rather led to sustained increases in the ratios of government expenditure and debt to gdp. allowing the free operation of automatic stabilisers in countries with strong fiscal positions and safeguarding the long-term sustainability of public finances are the best contributions that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with consolidation, in line with the requirements of the stability and growth pact. there is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the pact, thereby undermining its credibility.  structural reforms help economies to adjust to adverse shocks, foster productivity growth and increase employment and competition, thereby also helping to reduce inflationary pressures. in particular, enhancing competition in the services sectors and network industries, as well as applying adequate measures in the eu agricultural market, would be conducive to price stability in the euro area",regular economic monetary_analysis decide

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080110.en.html,10 January 2008,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. according to the latest information, strong short-term upward pressure on inflation has continued, with hicp inflation remaining at 3.1% in december. as regards the medium term, and in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth, our assessment of upside risks to price stability has been fully confirmed. the governing council remains prepared to act pre-emptively so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the governing council. the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. however, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still accompanied by uncertainty about its potential impact on the real economy and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity are on the downside. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  the latest information on economic activity suggests that quarterly growth at the turn of the year was at a more moderate pace than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007 (revised upwards from 0.7%). this assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which, while declining over the past few months, generally remain at levels that continue to point to ongoing growth.  our main scenario remains that of real gdp growth broadly in line with trend potential. the fundamentals of the euro area economy are sound, profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income, and investment growth should provide ongoing support. on the expectation that the global economy will, on balance, remain resilient – with the slowdown in economic growth in the united states being mitigated by the continued strength of emerging market economies – external demand should support euro area exports.  that said, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. the latter relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with a negative impact on world and euro area growth. further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances. with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate the annual hicp inflation rate was 3.1% in december 2007, unchanged from november. this confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from strong increases in oil and food prices in recent months.  looking ahead, the annual hicp inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. moreover, it is important to stress that the expectation of a moderation in the rate of inflation – which is embedded in the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections – assumes some reversal of the recent rises in commodity prices – in line with what is currently captured by futures prices – and, more fundamentally, that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on hicp inflation do not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour.  risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. these risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account capacity constraints and the positive developments in labour markets. furthermore, the pricing power of firms – notably in market segments with low competition – could be stronger than expected. at this juncture, it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. in the view of the governing council, this is absolutely essential in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. any indexation scheme of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated. finally, further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far, could materialise.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. the annual growth rate of m3 in november, unchanged at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. nonetheless, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.0% in november, points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to form a better understanding of shorter-term monetary dynamics.  such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. at the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil.  for the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. indeed, the growth of bank loans to the domestic private sector has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired thus far. the growth of m1 and household borrowing have moderated further over the past few quarters, reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 rather than the influence of the financial turmoil. borrowing by non-financial corporations remains very strong. further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. at the same time, the potential impact on the real economy of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets remains uncertain. consequently, we will monitor very closely all developments. the governing council remains prepared to act pre-emptively so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability do not materialise and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the governing council.  turning to fiscal policy, most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes. on this basis, after a reduction in the euro area aggregate deficit ratio in 2007, an increase in the ratio is projected for 2008 despite many countries not having achieved sound fiscal positions. there is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the stability and growth pact, thereby undermining the credibility of the pact. in 2008 some countries with fiscal imbalances will consolidate by less than the required minimum of 0.5% of gdp in structural terms. in these countries, much more ambitious policies will be necessary to ensure that they achieve their medium-term objectives by 2010 at the latest, in accordance with their commitment of april 2007. with regard to structural reforms, the new three-year cycle of the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has started. while the achievements made over the last three years of the relaunched strategy are encouraging, it is important that governments step up their reform efforts to deliver enhanced knowledge and innovation, competitiveness and labour market flexibility. such reforms are crucial to raising productivity and fostering employment opportunities in the euro

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is071206.en.html,6 December 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, with the hicp inflation rate reaching 3.0% in november. it has also fully confirmed our assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term. against this background, and with money and credit growth remaining very vigorous in the euro area, the governing council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by its mandate. the economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound. however, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy. we will therefore monitor very closely all developments. by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. firmly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  according to eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real gdp in the third quarter of 2007 was 0.7%, in line with the earlier flash estimate. domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the sustained nature of economic expansion in the euro area. the latest information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that economic growth has continued into the fourth quarter of this year, though probably at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter. overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound. profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen for 25 years.  these factors are also reflected in the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. annual real gdp growth is projected to lie in the range of 2.4% to 2.8% in 2007, and be between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2009. in comparison with the september ecb staff projections, the range projected for real gdp growth in 2008 has been revised slightly downwards, whereas for 2007 the new range lies within the upper part of the previous one. available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook.  the scenario of sustained real gdp growth broadly in line with trend potential is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the united states partly offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. external demand should therefore provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. consumption growth should also contribute to economic expansion, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. that said, in view of the potential impact of ongoing financial market volatility and re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty remains high.  in the governing council’s view, the risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth lie on the downside. they relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and confidence and on world and euro area growth, possible further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual hicp inflation rate increased sharply again in november 2007, to 3.0% from 2.6% in october. oil prices have risen strongly in recent months, and food prices have increased substantially, reflecting higher global demand. in addition, as emphasised on previous occasions, we are currently in the midst of a period in which unfavourable effects from energy prices are having a strong upward impact on annual hicp inflation rates, owing to the marked decline in oil prices a year ago. looking ahead, the hicp inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. the december eurosystem staff projections foresee annual hicp inflation to be between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2007, but then to rise to between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2008. for 2009, hicp inflation is projected to lie between 1.2% and 2.4%. compared with the september 2007 ecb staff projections, the projected ranges for hicp inflation in 2007 and 2008 have shifted upwards. forecasts from international organisations which incorporate recent inflation developments give a broadly similar picture. these projections largely mirror the assumed path of oil and food prices, for which available futures prices suggest a deceleration in the course of next year. on the domestic side, unit labour cost growth is projected to increase over the projection horizon. in this context it is important to emphasise that the staff projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on hicp inflation will not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage-setting behaviour. this is a key assumption. a further key assumption is that growth in profit margins will moderate over the projection horizon. in combination, these two assumptions imply, in the context of the staff projections, a continuation of overall contained domestic cost pressures, which contributes to the moderation in inflation projected in 2009.  in the governing council’s view, risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. these risks include the possibility of further rises in oil and agricultural prices , continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive developments in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge. furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from recent commodity price rises be avoided. to that end, any explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. the annual growth rate of m3 in october, at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. however, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.2% in october, points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to better understand shorter-term dynamics.  such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. at the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil.  for the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been affected. indeed, the growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired. further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market developments on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of vigorous money and credit growth and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. at the same time, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy has continued. consequently, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. in particular, for the recent increase in inflation to remain temporary, it is of the essence that no second-round effects materialise via an impact from current inflation rates on wage and price-setting behaviour. by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. this is all the more important in the current context. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. turning to fiscal policy, the european commission’s autumn 2007 economic forecast generally confirms the picture of improving budget balances in the euro area this year. however, progress with structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining budget imbalances is generally disappointing. this lack of ambition unnecessarily prolongs the correction of remaining fiscal deficits and could lead to negative surprises should the macroeconomic environment turn less favourable. in this context, member states should meet the commitment they made in the eurogroup’s berlin agreement of april 2007, namely that most euro area members would achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all should aim for 2010 at the latest. with regard to structural reforms, it is important that governments continue their efforts to make progress. the improvements in the employment situation over recent years show the fruits of past reforms. it is essential that the reform momentum to enhance competition, productivity growth and labour market flexibility is maintained and that there are no reversals of the reform process in the countries

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is071108.en.html,8 November 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our previous meeting fully confirms that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks. against this background, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. the economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound and support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity. however, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets has led to continued uncertainty. this warrants a thorough examination of additional information before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability. accordingly, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. this will favour an environment conducive to sustained economic growth, well-functioning markets and job creation. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. on the basis of the available data, it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the third quarter, as reflected in the data for industrial production and retail sales that have been released since our meeting in early october. while financial market volatility seems to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in the past few months, these indicators generally remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth. overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound, including in particular sustained corporate earnings and profitability, robust employment growth and falling unemployment to levels not seen for 25 years. available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real gdp growing at around trend potential. this scenario is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the united states partly offset by the sustained strength of emerging market economies. continued strong external demand should provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. that said, in view of the potential impact of prolonged financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity remains high.  on balance, risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. these downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions, further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual hicp inflation rate increased very strongly to 2.6% in october 2007, from 2.1% in september. this sharp increase is a matter of particular concern and it is essential that it does not affect medium to longer-term inflation expectations. to that effect, we have already indicated on previous occasions that we are now in a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong upward impact on annual hicp inflation rates, owing mainly to the marked decline in energy prices a year ago. in addition, these effects have been strengthened by recent substantial further increases in oil, non-oil commodity and, in particular, food prices. overall, we expect the hicp inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months before moderating again in the course of 2008.  risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. these risks include the possibility of persistently high oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as unanticipated increases in administered prices and indirect taxes. moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters, and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur. furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. such developments would pose upward risks to price stability. it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects be avoided. in addition, the explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be reduced and ultimately eliminated. the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. the strength of both money and credit growth in recent months – with the annual growth rates of m3 and mfi loans to the private sector both at more than 11% in september – may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility. however, even taking into account these special factors, the underlying rate of money and credit expansion remains strong. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other. this monitoring will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important given recent financial market developments, since financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby affect monetary developments. monetary and credit data can therefore offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility. indeed, previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. for the time being, however, there is little evidence that such shifts have influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates since the onset of financial market volatility in early august, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been strongly affected.  the rate of growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, tentatively suggesting that there is no impairment in credit supply. however, it cannot be excluded that the strong loan flows partly reflect the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets given illiquidity in some segments of the asset-backed securities markets. further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. to sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has fully confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term, with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. at the same time, given the continued uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. consequently, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important in the current context. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. turning to fiscal policy, the governing council welcomes the ecofin council’s agreement to strengthen the preventive arm of the stability and growth pact. the governing council also welcomes the recent confirmation by the ecofin council of a reinforcement of its commitment to the full implementation of the pact. in particular, the provisions of the preventive arm, including the call for a structural adjustment of at least 0.5% of gdp per annum, need to be adhered to by all countries with fiscal imbalances. in this regard, 2008 budget plans in a number of countries point to a pro-cyclical fiscal stance and an unwarranted relaxation of consolidation efforts. this gives rise to concern as consolidation shortfalls undermine in particular the eurogroup agreement to achieve sound budgetary positions by 2010 at the latest.  with regard to structural reforms, the governing council stresses that a key effect of well-designed structural reforms is a sustainable improvement in the employment and income situation of workers and households. reforms which increase the incentives for firms and individuals to invest in human capital tend to enhance overall labour demand and productivity. reducing non-wage labour costs would also enhance employment and the net income levels of workers. moreover, labour market regulations should not discourage firms from offering jobs, or workers from accepting them. it is encouraging to see that past labour market reforms have contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment. it is important that governments continue in this direction and do not reverse past reforms just at the point when they are starting to bear fruit. moreover, the governing council reiterates its full support for all efforts which foster market flexibility and enhance competition. this also applies to the agricultural markets. against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, further liberalisation and reforms in eu agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit european consumers through lower prices",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available previous fully confirm outlook

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is071004.en.html,4 October 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our previous meeting has confirmed that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks. against this background, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our primary objective. the fundamentals of the euro area economy support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity. in particular, corporate earnings and profitability have been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment has fallen. however, given the financial market volatility and the reappraisal of risk seen in recent weeks, this assessment is surrounded by heightened uncertainty. in view of the only limited range of new economic data that have become available since our meeting in early september, particular caution needs to be exercised when assessing any potential impact of the financial market developments on the real economy. hence, it remains necessary to gather additional information and examine new data before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability. accordingly, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. on the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby favouring an environment conducive to sustained economic growth, well-functioning markets and job creation. providing such an anchor for medium and long-term inflation expectations is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. on the basis of the available data, it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the summer. this is also reflected in available forecasts for real gdp growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2007. while financial market volatility appears to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in september, these indicators remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth during the second half of 2007.  looking further ahead, available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real gdp growing at around trend potential. this scenario is based on the expectation that global economic activity will remain robust, with the moderation of economic growth in the united states largely offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. this will provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions remain supportive. that said, in view of the potential impact of increased financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the uncertainties surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity have increased.  on balance, risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. these downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions, concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances, as well as further oil and commodity price rises. as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual hicp inflation rate increased strongly to 2.1% in september 2007, from 1.7% in august. as we have already indicated on previous occasions, we are now entering a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong impact on annual hicp inflation rates. owing mainly to such effects, as a result of the marked decline in energy prices a year ago combined with the recent substantial increase in oil prices, we expect the inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the remaining months of 2007 and in early 2008, before moderating again. largely as a consequence of capacity constraints and relatively tight labour market conditions, inflation is expected to be around 2% on average in 2008.  risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they continue to include the possibility of further increases in the prices of oil and agricultural products as well as additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur, and an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. such developments would pose upward risks to price stability. it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. a broad assessment of the monetary data supports the view that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. however, the august annual growth rate of close to 12% in the monetary aggregate m3 as well as the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations, which reached a record level of more than 14% in august, may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility, and may therefore overstate the underlying rate of money and credit expansion.  a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important during the current period of financial market volatility, as the latter may influence the short-term behaviour of private agents and thereby affect monetary developments. thus, monetary and credit data can offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility. indeed, previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. for the time being, however, there is still little evidence in the monetary data for such shifts since the rise in financial market volatility in early august, while it cannot be excluded that the flow of bank loans to the non-financial corporate sector in august partly reflects the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets. further data will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. overall, the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other. this will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. to sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term, against the background of good economic fundamentals in the euro area. accordingly, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our primary objective. at the same time, given the heightened level of uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. consequently, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. on the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important in the current context. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. turning to fiscal policy, the governing council is increasingly concerned about a weakening in structural fiscal consolidation efforts and the delaying of decisive action to address fiscal imbalances. against this background, all euro area countries concerned are urged to meet the commitments made in the context of the stability and growth pact to structurally improve their fiscal balances. the commitment made in the eurogroup to reach medium-term budgetary objectives in 2008 or 2009, and by 2010 at the latest, must also be respected by all euro area countries. those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. sound fiscal policies will also make an important contribution to maintaining confidence at a time of heightened uncertainty in financial markets.  with regard to structural reforms, the governing council fully supports efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. while the services sector is a particularly important area for reform, further efforts are also needed to improve the functioning of the agricultural markets. against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, further liberalisation and reforms in the eu agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit european consumers through lower prices. the successful conclusion of the doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in europe and worldwide in particular",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available previous confirm outlook price stability medium_term subject upside

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070906.en.html,6 September 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our previous meeting has confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, as identified by both our economic and monetary analyses. incoming macroeconomic data also confirm the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy and support a favourable medium-term outlook for real gdp growth. against this background, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. at the same time, the financial market volatility and reappraisal of risk of recent weeks have led to an increase in uncertainty. given this high level of uncertainty, it is appropriate to gather additional information and to examine new data before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy aimed at delivering price stability. accordingly, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. on the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. this is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. all in all, the data available suggest that economic activity in the euro area is continuing to expand at sustained rates. euro area real gdp growth in the second quarter moderated to 0.3% quarter on quarter, compared with 0.7% in the previous quarter. however, due account should be taken of the volatility of these growth rates. accordingly, economic growth during the first half of 2007, as a whole, was in line with potential growth. data on activity in the third quarter – from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – remain favourable overall and support the assessment that real gdp is growing at sustained rates. in particular, the latest data on unemployment are favourable and the levels of all confidence indicators to august were high. global economic activity is expected to remain robust, as the likely slowdown in the united states is expected to be largely offset by the continued strong growth in emerging markets. this will continue to provide support to euro area exports and investment. in addition, consumption growth in the euro area should strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. that said, in view of the overall potential impact of increased financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, appropriate monitoring of the economy’s evolution is necessary.  this outlook is also reflected in the september 2007 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which for the first time include cyprus and malta. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2007, and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. in comparison with the june eurosystem staff projections, the range projected for real gdp growth in 2007 has been revised slightly downwards, mainly reflecting the assumptions of somewhat higher oil prices and slightly tighter market financing conditions due to higher average risk premia.  in the view of the governing council, the ranges presented serve as a good reminder of the general uncertainty surrounding economic projections, which it is worthwhile emphasising given the current volatility in the financial markets. the risks to these projections for economic growth are judged to lie on the downside. these downside risks relate mainly to a potentially broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets, global imbalances and protectionist pressures, as well as further oil and commodity price rises.  with respect to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.8% in august 2007, the same rate as in the previous month. however, over the remainder of this year, inflation rates are likely to increase again to above 2%. in the september 2007 ecb staff projections, annual hicp inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.1% in 2007, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008. in 2008, a declining impact from indirect taxes and energy prices is expected to be compensated by higher pressures from unit labour costs. compared with the june 2007 eurosystem staff projections, the new ranges for 2007 and 2008 are within the ranges previously projected.  the governing council is of the view that risks to this outlook for price developments lie on the upside. these upside risks include increases in indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far and further increases in oil prices and prices for agricultural products. more fundamentally, stronger than expected wage developments and an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition may occur. such developments would pose upside risks to price stability. it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. the potential materialisation of these risks – or their abatement – requires close monitoring. the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. on the basis of the latest available data (covering the period to the end of july), the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion remains strong. this is reflected in the rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregate, m3, which grew at an annual rate of 11.7% in july, and the strength of mfi loans to the private sector, which continue to increase at double-digit rates on an annual basis. when identifying and assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary expansion, it is important to look through short-term volatility and the impact of temporary factors on developments in specific monetary aggregates. taking the appropriate broader and medium-term-oriented perspective, there are several indications that increases in short-term interest rates over recent quarters have influenced monetary developments. for example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more modest expansion of m1, as the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of m3 has increased. moreover, higher short-term rates have led to some stabilisation in the growth of mfi credit to the private sector, albeit at double-digit annual rates, with the growth of household borrowing moderating as house price dynamics and real estate activity have slowed. however, these developments are yet to dampen the overall rate of monetary expansion, as the flattening of the yield curve has increased the attractiveness of monetary assets relative to less liquid longer-maturity instruments, thereby causing broad money growth to rise. furthermore, the growth of loans to non-financial companies has shown renewed vigour in recent months. in the current situation, let me remind you that volatility in financial markets can temporarily exert considerable influence over monetary dynamics. in previous episodes, private sector perceptions of and attitudes towards risk, and the resulting portfolio behaviour, have strongly affected monetary developments. the monetary data for july may already have been partly influenced by such portfolio considerations and this could possibly apply even more to the august data to be released later in september. however, as has been demonstrated in the past, an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the monetary data can help in our understanding of the impact of financial developments on monetary developments and to extract the policy-relevant signal in monetary growth with regard to longer-term inflationary trends. in such circumstances, the broad-based approach adopted in the ecb’s monetary analysis is at a premium. overall, the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring. to sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term – against the background of the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy. accordingly, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. at the same time, given the high level of uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. accordingly, the governing council will monitor very closely all developments. on the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. in the current context, it is all the more important that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. as regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. in the area of fiscal policy, progress in structural fiscal consolidation remains slow and there are risks that some countries will pursue expansionary pro-cyclical fiscal policies. for the execution of 2007 budgets and the planning of 2008 budgets, it is crucial that the mistakes made during the previous economic upswing of 1999-2000 are not repeated. at present, countries with fiscal imbalances need to correct them in line with the requirements of the stability and growth pact. the commitment in the eurogroup to reach medium-term budgetary objectives in 2008 or 2009, and by 2010 at the latest, has to be respected by all euro area member countries. those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. turning to structural reform, the governing council welcomes further efforts to increase the productive capacity of the euro area through higher employment. euro area labour markets have shown clear signs of progress in the last few years, partly reflecting the impact of past labour market reforms. further progress is needed, however, to enhance occupational and geographical labour mobility and skill creation, so as to overcome the comparatively low rates of labour market participation and still high unemployment rates in some countries and regions",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available previous confirm

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070705.en.html,5 July 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in june. it has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. given the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample. looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. the governing council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive, supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates in line with our baseline scenario.  looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate. as regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust. external conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from overall financing conditions which remain favourable, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period. meanwhile, consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions continue to improve.  the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. at medium to longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, owing mainly to external factors. these relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices, concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment.  as regards price developments, as reflected in eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.9% in june 2007, unchanged from previous months. looking ahead, the short-term profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments, as last year’s volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects. on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, which show an upward slope, annual inflation rates are likely to fall only slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year. at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside. these risks relate notably to the domestic side. in particular, as capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets continue to improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments. in addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment. such developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability. it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments. the governing council stresses the importance of avoiding wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. in addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far, and the potentially procyclical stance of fiscal policy in some countries. finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. the ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of m3, which increased at an annual rate of 10.7% in may, as well as the still high level of credit growth. the strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects, in part, favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth.  when identifying and assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary and credit expansion, it is important to look through shorter-term volatility and the effects of changes in the slope of the yield curve and external factors that are likely to prove temporary. taking this perspective, there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion. for example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate, m1, in recent quarters. equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. the stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broad-based, and is apparent in borrowing by both non-financial corporations and households. in the latter case, the stabilisation of loan growth also reflects some moderation in house price dynamics, although house price growth nonetheless remains at high levels on average in the euro area. given the continued vigour of money and credit expansion, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample. in this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. to sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to the domestic side. as capacity utilisation is high and labour markets continue to improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage and profit margin developments. given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. accordingly, the governing council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. as regards fiscal policy, the governing council notes with concern the pressures emerging in a number of countries to relax previous fiscal consolidation targets. in the current overall benign economic environment, it is imperative that all governments comply with the provisions of the stability and growth pact on fiscal consolidation in economic “good times” and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments they made at the eurogroup meeting in berlin on 20 april 2007. as agreed in berlin, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest. these pledges should be reflected in the 2008 budget plans so as to avoid repeating governments’ past failure to adjust fiscal balances in economic “good times”. at the same time, the governing council welcomes the emphasis placed by the ecofin council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances. as regards structural reforms, the governing council fully supports all measures that improve the functioning of product, labour and financial markets. in the context of the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs, the eu member states noted that a well-functioning internal market remains at the heart of the lisbon agenda and that its four freedoms will reinforce the european union’s competitiveness. the completion of the single market is therefore a priority for member states, in particular as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the services directive. increased market competition and a reduction of cross-border barriers are beneficial for consumers since they lead to lower prices and a greater choice of products. for firms, they lead to higher efficiency, greater dynamism and an enhanced capacity to cope with economic shocks and to face the challenges and opportunities posed by globalisation. following the principle of “an open market economy with free competition” is pivotal to fostering long-term economic growth and job creation, increasing the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks and facilitating the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. this was confirmed at the last european council meeting, when the eu leaders agreed to annex a new protocol to the treaties, in the context of the intergovernmental conference. this protocol underlines the fact that an internal market which includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted is indeed indispensable for the good functioning of the eu economies",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070606.en.html,6 June 2007,"at today’s meeting, we decided to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision was taken in view of the prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards fostering sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. after today’s increase, given the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample. looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. the governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. incoming information clearly confirms that the euro area economy continues to expand at a pace which is significantly stronger than generally expected a year ago. with a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.6%, real gdp growth in the first quarter of 2007 was again somewhat above previous expectations. other available information on economic activity, notably various surveys of business and consumer confidence, suggests that solid growth has continued into the second quarter.  looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate. as regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust. external conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from financing conditions which remain favourable, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period. meanwhile, consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions continue to improve. this outlook is also reflected in the new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 2.3% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. in comparison with the previous ecb staff projections, the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2007 are within the upper part of the ranges from march. for 2008, the ranges have been revised marginally downwards, following the increase in oil prices over recent months.  in the governing council’s view, the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. at medium to longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, owing mainly to external factors. these relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices, concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment.  as regards price developments, oil prices have risen again over recent months. accordingly, as reflected in eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.9% in may 2007, unchanged from april but somewhat higher than expected a few months ago. looking ahead, the short-term profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments, as last year’s volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects. on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, which show an upward slope, annual inflation rates are likely to fall slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year. consistent with this view, eurosystem staff projects average annual hicp inflation of between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. compared with the march 2007 ecb staff projections, the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat higher, largely reflecting higher oil prices. the projected range for inflation in 2008 is unchanged. in this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including assumptions for future short and long-term interest rates that are based on market expectations derived from the yield curve, as well as assumptions for oil and non-energy commodity prices.  at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside in the governing council’s view. these risks relate notably to the domestic side. in particular, capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is increasing and labour markets are gradually improving. accordingly, there is a risk that wage developments will be stronger than expected, which would pose significant upward risks to price stability. in addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment. it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments. the governing council stresses that wage developments should be avoided which would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. in addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices beyond those anticipated thus far. finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. the ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of m3, which reached an annual rate of 10.4% in april, as well as the still high level of credit growth. the strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects, in part, favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth.  in the short term, monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. in assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary and credit growth, it is important to look through such transitory aspects. taking this perspective, there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion. for example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate, m1, in recent quarters. equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. the stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broad-based, as evidenced in recent months by developments in borrowing by non-financial corporations and by households. at the same time, house price growth has come down somewhat, although remaining at high levels on average in the euro area. taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample. in this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. to sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to the domestic side. as capacity utilisation increases and labour markets gradually improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments. given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. accordingly, the governing council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. as regards fiscal policy, all countries should be in line with the rules and provisions of the stability and growth pact. this will be crucial for the smooth functioning of monetary union, given that the stability and growth pact is an indispensable part of its institutional setting. following the significant budgetary improvement recorded in 2006, the latest available forecasts suggest a further reduction in the government deficit-to-gdp ratio of the euro area over the period 2007-08. this reflects in particular projected ongoing strong revenue collection in the context of a favourable macroeconomic outlook. however, the structural improvement is more muted. the current economic “good times” should be used to rapidly redress the remaining budgetary imbalances in euro area countries as well as to accelerate the adjustment towards their medium-term objectives of sound budget positions with a focus on expenditure restraint. as agreed by the euro area finance ministers at the eurogroup meeting in berlin on 20 april, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area members to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest. this is particularly important with a view to reducing the still high government debt ratios and preparing for the fiscal challenges arising from population ageing. in order to ensure that fiscal developments are monitored effectively, the governing council supports all efforts by eurostat to improve the fiscal data situation. it also welcomes the increased emphasis placed by the ecofin council on measures to improve the quality of public finances and increase the efficiency of public administration. as regards structural reforms, the governing council fully supports any efforts that enhance competition, increase productivity and foster economic flexibility, thus promoting higher sustainable real gdp growth and employment. in this respect, we strongly back reforms focusing on reducing labour market rigidities, product market barriers and administrative burdens, and on stimulating technological innovation. exploiting the complementary nature of reforms would increase their benefits in terms of long-term economic dynamism and price stability. furthermore, the importance of a successful conclusion of the doha round of trade talks for productivity and growth in europe should not be underestimated. in the end, higher productivity growth will allow increases in real wages without negatively affecting employment, thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area workforce",today decide raise key_interest_rate point decision view prevail upside risk price stability medium_term identify economic monetary_analysis today

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070510.en.html,10 May 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in march. strong vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. in turn, this will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ecb interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted.  turning first to the economic analysis, the latest indicators and survey data confirm that the expansion of economic activity continued in the first quarter of 2007 and remains solid and broad-based. looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic growth in the euro area continues to be favourable. conditions are in place for the ongoing expansion to proceed at sustained rates. global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat in recent quarters, remains strong. external conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency. consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions. the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. at longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, stemming mainly from external factors. such factors include fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.8% in april 2007, after 1.9% in march. looking at the coming months, barring further increases in oil prices, significant base effects deriving from last year’s energy price volatility will strongly influence the profile of annual inflation rates. on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall somewhat in the months to come, before rising again towards the end of the year to hover at levels around 2%.  over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks. these relate notably to the increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area economy, the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. more fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. it is crucial that the social partners meet their responsibilities so as to continue to avoid wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. in this context, it is also important to point out that wage agreements should be sufficiently differentiated and take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and productivity developments across sectors.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. the ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of m3, which in march reached an annual rate of 10.9%, as well as in the ongoing high levels of credit growth. monetary and credit expansion is due partly to the moderate level of interest rates and solid economic growth.  short-term monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. looking through such transitory aspects, there are, however, several indications that higher short-term interest rates are influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of these dynamics. for example, increases in short-term rates have served to moderate the expansion of the narrow aggregate, m1, in recent quarters, but its annual growth is still robust. equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels.  all in all, taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. in fact, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. in this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. to sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity. given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. accordingly, the governing council will continue to be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted.  in relation to fiscal policies, the governing council welcomes the recent commitment by the euro area finance ministers – at the eurogroup meeting in berlin on 20 april – to make full use of the current economic growth and better than expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies and to avoid procyclical policies in line with the provisions of the stability and growth pact. in the view of the governing council, this requires a rigorous implementation of 2007 budgets, the avoidance of expenditure overruns and the full allocation of unexpected extra revenues to deficit and debt reduction. for 2008, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances are expected to pursue more ambitious than planned budgetary targets as a result, all euro area countries should achieve their medium-term objective of sound budgetary positions as soon as possible and by 2010 at the latest. moreover, all countries should avoid fiscal policies that feed macroeconomic imbalances. this would allow euro area countries to prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions. as repeatedly stressed, the governing council fully supports structural reforms that enhance competition, increase productivity and foster economic flexibility, thus promoting the potential for real gdp growth and employment. increased productivity also allows for increases in real wages without negatively impacting on employment, thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area work force. in recent years, average wage increases in the euro area as a whole have been rather moderate, making a vital contribution to job creation and lower unemployment. it is important that this favourable trend in labour markets continues, so contributing to a prolonged and robust upswing. in this respect, sufficient wage differentiation is required so as to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in sectors and regions with high unemployment. furthermore, the removal of impediments to labour mobility would help to address local imbalances in labour markets and to enhance the adjustment flexibility of euro area economies to economic shocks. the euro area could reap major benefits from these policies in terms of economic dynamism, more job creation, lower unemployment and increased per capita income",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available far underpin reasoning decision increase interest_rate strong vigilance essence order

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070412.en.html,12 April 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in march. it has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, so that very close monitoring of all developments is warranted. indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ecb interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted.  turning first to the economic analysis, recent information has underpinned our assessment of ongoing robust economic growth dynamics in the euro area. eurostat’s second estimate has confirmed quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 at 0.9%. over the whole year 2006, real gdp grew by 2.7% in the euro area, unadjusted for the number of working days. on the basis of the latest data, survey releases and various indicator-based estimates, it appears that robust growth is continuing in the first half of 2007.  looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. as regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains strong. external conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions. the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. at longer horizons, downside risks remain, stemming mainly from the external side. they relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.9% in march 2007, compared with 1.8% in the first two months of the year. a detailed breakdown of the march hicp data is not yet available. looking ahead, barring further increases in oil prices, last year’s volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, thereby affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall in the months to come, before rising towards the end of the year to hover again at around 2%.  over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks. these relate to the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. more fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. it is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. in this context, wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, as well as productivity developments. the governing council monitors the wage negotiations in euro area countries with particular attention. the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. annual m3 growth increased further to 10.0% in february, from 9.9% in january. at the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, while remaining very strong at 10.3% in february, showed some further signs of moderation. whereas in previous months this moderation reflected a decline in the growth rate of household borrowing in an environment of rising mortgage lending rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions, in february it was due to a moderation in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations. when assessing such developments, it should be borne in mind that monthly figures can be influenced by temporary factors and should thus not be overstated. indeed, the strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the strong trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004.  when put in perspective, the latest data continue to point to vigorous dynamics in the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area. the continued robust expansion of money and credit reflects the low levels of interest rates over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. rising short-term interest rates, in combination with low long-term interest rates, have had an impact on developments in the individual components of monetary and credit aggregates, but have thus far had only a limited influence on the overall strength of monetary developments. following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. in this environment of ample liquidity, the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. to sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates. the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity. given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor very closely all developments. indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted.  concerning other policy areas, the governing council welcomed the recommendations addressed to the euro area countries in the 2007 update of the integrated guidelines, which was endorsed by the european council at its meeting on 8 and 9 march, particularly to speed up fiscal consolidation, to improve the quality of public finances, to foster competition and integration, and to promote labour market reforms. indeed, as regards fiscal policy, it is of the utmost importance to use the momentum of the improved economic situation and to press ahead vigorously with budgetary consolidation. government deficit and debt-to-gdp ratios in euro area countries in 2006 have turned out to be significantly better than anticipated. but this positive outcome largely reflects buoyant tax revenues in the context of a favourable macroeconomic environment, offsetting in some cases higher than planned public expenditure. the better than expected fiscal outcomes in 2006 should lead to more ambitious targets for 2007 and beyond, allowing revenue windfalls to be fully allocated to deficit and debt reduction. furthermore, procyclical fiscal policies should be avoided in all countries. this is of vital importance to ensure fiscal sustainability in preparation for the impact of ageing populations and is fully in line with the revised stability and growth pact. reviewing public expenditure and taxation so as to improve the quality of public finances would additionally foster economic growth and fiscal sustainability. we also support ambitious structural reforms, which would further contribute to the smooth functioning of monetary union and support growth potential and job creation. in particular, improving labour market flexibility to better align wage and productivity developments and facilitating labour mobility would further strengthen the resilience of countries to shocks and ensure their competitiveness",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070308.en.html,8 March 2007,"at today’s meeting, we decided to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision was taken in view of the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards fostering sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. after today’s increase, given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ecb interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. the governing council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.  turning first to the economic analysis, according to eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real gdp in the euro area for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 0.9%, which was above previous expectations. our current assessment is that the quarterly profile of real gdp growth is likely to be somewhat smoother in response to the impact of indirect tax changes in one large euro area country than had originally been anticipated. the strength of real gdp growth in the fourth quarter is thus indicative of ongoing robust growth in the euro area. both domestic demand and exports made significant contributions to real gdp growth, confirming the sustained and broad-based nature of the current expansion. the information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued into 2007. looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. as regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust, supported in part by lower oil prices. external conditions thus provide support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. this outlook is also reflected in the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 2.1% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2008. in comparison with the december eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2007 and 2008 have been revised upwards, largely reflecting the strength of gdp growth in the second half of 2006 and the lower energy prices, which, if sustained, would have a positive impact on real disposable income. in the governing council’s view, the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. at longer horizons, risks lie mainly on the downside. the main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.8% in february 2007, unchanged from january 2007. the fall in headline inflation rates since the summer of 2006 has been predominantly due to lower energy prices. looking ahead, last year’s volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall during the spring and summer before rising again towards the end of the year and then most likely hovering again at around 2%. the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual hicp inflation averaging between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. compared with the december 2006 eurosystem staff projections, the upper bound of the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat lower, largely reflecting the fall in oil prices. by contrast, the projected range for inflation in 2008 is slightly higher, largely on account of the anticipated stronger economic growth, which could exert more intense pressure on factor utilisation and factor costs. in this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for future short and long-term interest rates as well as for oil and non-energy commodity prices.  at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains, in the governing council’s view, subject to upside risks. these relate to the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. more fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters. it is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. in this context, wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, as well as productivity developments. the governing council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. annual m3 growth was unchanged at 9.8% in january, thus remaining at the highest rate observed since the introduction of the euro. at 10.6%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also remained strong in january. strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. meanwhile, in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still high rates.  taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures.  the robust expansion of money and credit reflects the accommodative monetary policy stance over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. in an environment of ample liquidity, it points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. to sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates. the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of robust ongoing growth in employment and economic activity. given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. the governing council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted.  as regards fiscal policy, there is growing confirmation that the favourable cyclical developments led to better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 in a number of countries and in the euro area as a whole. however, updated stability programmes foresee only moderate progress with fiscal consolidation in the coming years. in this respect, some countries’ consolidation targets appear not fully in line with the requirements of the revised stability and growth pact. risks stem in particular from a lack of well-specified and credible measures, notably on the expenditure side of budgets.  given the favourable economic environment, the governing council considers it essential that pro-cyclical policies are avoided in all euro area countries and that sufficiently ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts are made in the countries with remaining budgetary imbalances and/or high public debt outstanding. the opportunity should be seized to attain sound public finances within the programme horizons and by 2010 at the latest in all euro area countries. fiscal consolidation that is part of a medium-term-oriented, credible and expenditure-based reform strategy would support longer-term output and employment growth and help prepare for the fiscal impact of population ageing.  as regards structural reforms, the european council will discuss the current state of, and future progress in, the implementation of the lisbon strategy at its meeting which starts today. it is positive to see that reforms and moderate increases in labour costs have helped to bring about higher employment and lower unemployment in recent years, although progress has been uneven across eu member states. we encourage action to create incentives and structures which support the integration of all groups into the labour market, including those for which employment rates have been relatively low in the past. reforms of tax and benefit systems should enhance incentives to work and to create jobs. reducing labour taxes (including social security contributions) and thereby labour costs would support employment, while setting minimum wages at a level not in line with productivity reduces the employment chances of less skilled workers. we fully support policies to improve education and the adoption of technological innovations in order to raise productivity growth. coupled with initiatives to create a business-friendly environment, such policies would broaden the opportunities of all to participate in an enhanced growth process",today decide raise key_interest_rate point decision view

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070208.en.html,8 February 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our previous decisions to raise interest rates. it has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. as emphasised on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. our monetary policy remains accommodative, with the key ecb interest rates still at low levels, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail. turning first to the economic analysis, the latest indicators and survey data suggest that the economic expansion has continued into 2007 and remains solid and broad-based. looking ahead, while some volatility in the quarter-on-quarter growth rates of real gdp cannot be excluded, the medium-term outlook for economic activity continues to be favourable. conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to continue to expand at rates around potential. global economic growth, which has become more balanced across regions, remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum. investment should remain dynamic, reflecting the benefits of an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption should also continue to gradually strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions – in particular employment growth – continue to improve.  risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. at longer horizons, risks lie mainly on the downside. the main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. with regard to price developments, it is essential to stress the importance of taking a medium-term perspective and to look through the possible volatility of inflation rates over the course of 2007. in this respect, it may be helpful to consider the potential volatility of inflation in greater detail. in the very short term, it appears that the changes in vat in a large euro area country were not fully reflected in prices in january. thereafter, it should be noted that on the basis of current prices for oil and oil futures and previous oil price developments, significant favourable base effects may progressively lead to lower inflation rates in the spring and summer. however, these effects will be temporary. later in 2007 inflation rates are expected to rise again as a result of unfavourable base effects.  the medium to longer-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. they continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. more fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability, given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters, the fact that survey measures of capacity utilisation are approaching the peak levels reached in 2000, and the ongoing improvement in labour market performance. it is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. in this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. indeed, the governing council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully.  the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. annual m3 growth rose further to 9.7% in december, marking the largest increase seen since the introduction of the euro. of course, monthly figures can be volatile and we should not overemphasise short-term developments. however, continued strong money and credit growth confirm the view that the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area remains vigorous, with no evidence as yet that the steady upward trend observed since mid-2004 has been halted or even reversed.  the ongoing robust expansion of money and credit reflects the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. at 10.7%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained strong in december, although showing a slight moderation with respect to the previous month. strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. meanwhile, in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and slowing housing markets in some regions, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still very high rates.  taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. persistent strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. to sum up, in assessing price trends it is particularly important to look through any short-term volatility. on the basis of today’s assessment, after a possible fall over the spring and summer, inflation rates are likely to increase again later in the year. risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments. given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. hence, we will be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. as regards fiscal policy, first indications confirm that fiscal developments in the euro area were relatively favourable in 2006 on the back of strong output growth and revenue windfalls. it is now essential that the momentum of improving public finances is maintained and that the pace of fiscal consolidation accelerates in 2007 and 2008 so that all euro area countries attain their medium-term objective of a sound fiscal position as soon as possible. better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 and possible further revenue windfalls this year should be used for faster fiscal consolidation. experience has shown that the temptation to relax expenditure restraint, delay necessary reforms or pursue pro-cyclical policies in an upswing needs to be firmly resisted. fiscal consolidation measures have the best chance of success when they are based on a credible and comprehensive reform strategy, with a focus on reducing expenditure rather than increasing revenue ratios.  the governing council stressed that progress in the area of structural reforms and moderate increases in labour costs in some countries have been key factors in increasing employment and reducing unemployment over the last few years. indeed, while still high at a rate of 7.5% in december 2006, the standardised unemployment rate was the lowest since the series began in 1993 and has fallen by 1.4 percentage points since its latest peak in june 2004. to fully exploit the beneficial effects of economic and monetary union and the single market, further structural reforms must enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area. this includes sufficient wage differentiation, especially to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in regions with high unemployment. it also encompasses more flexible product and labour markets that would give rise to new investment possibilities and innovation. and it requires the removal of impediments to labour mobility – between jobs, between regions and across borders. let me therefore recall that with slovenia having entered the euro area, its labour force needs to be granted full access to the labour markets of all euro area countries. generally, structural reforms, in combination with fiscal consolidation, must support sustainable developments by limiting the burden that is shifted to younger and future generations. considerable challenges therefore remain, which differ across countries but which all urgently require determined action",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available far underpin reasoning

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2007/html/is070111.en.html,11 January 2007,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in december. it has also confirmed that very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, with the key ecb interest rates remaining at low levels, money and credit growth very strong, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. turning first to the economic analysis, quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth in the euro area was 0.5% in the third quarter of 2006, after very strong growth in the first half of last year. domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth, thus confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. drawing on the latest information, the evidence from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued and that the situation in labour markets has improved further. while some volatility in the quarter-on-quarter growth rates around the turn of the year may be observed – associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country – the information available continues to be in line with our baseline scenario. looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity continues to be favourable and the conditions remain for the euro area economy to grow solidly, at rates around potential. as for the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions, with some deceleration in the us and resilient growth elsewhere. overall, global growth should remain robust and therefore continue to provide support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. in the governing council’s view, the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the coming years lie mainly on the downside. the main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances.  with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 1.9% in december 2006, unchanged from the previous month. on account of their volatility over recent months, and owing to base effects, energy prices will continue to play an important role in determining the profile of annual rates of hicp inflation in early 2007, together with the impact of higher indirect taxes. looking further ahead, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% over this year and next. in the governing council’s view, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a stronger than anticipated pass-through of previous oil price increases, increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far, and the possibility of renewed oil price increases. more fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth over the past few quarters and positive labour market developments, wage dynamics could be stronger than currently expected. it is therefore crucial that social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. in this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments, while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. as stated on previous occasions, it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. turning to the monetary analysis, annual m3 growth rose to 9.3% in november. this represents its highest annual rate of growth since the introduction of the euro and, indeed, its strongest aggregate growth in the euro area group of countries since 1990. while the significance of monthly figures should not be overstated, as they may also be influenced by temporary factors, the series of strong monetary data over the past couple of months underscore the continued very dynamic underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area. rising short-term interest rates, in combination with low long-term interest rates, have exerted only a limited influence over monetary developments in recent months. this has mainly taken the form of shifts among the components of m3 rather than constraining the overall expansion of m3 itself. in particular, over recent months the annual growth rate of m1 has moderated somewhat, reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of m3 that offer more market-related returns. all in all, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. in particular, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector was 11.2% in november, unchanged from the previous month. while – in the context of rising interest rates – the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months, albeit at very high rates, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards. thus, credit continues to expand rapidly and in a broad-based fashion, thereby remaining the main driver of the current strong monetary growth when viewed from the counterpart side of the mfi balance sheet. taking a medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% this year and next, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. hence, very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. this will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. as regards fiscal policy, almost all euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes. while these programmes generally indicate that governments plan to proceed towards sound budgetary positions, there are also indications that budget targets do not consistently imply sufficient consolidation and that concrete and credible measures have not yet been specified in all programmes. these indications are a cause of concern and entail risks for the future. against the background of current good times, it is essential that sound budgetary positions are reached in countries with fiscal imbalances and that a pro-cyclical loosening is avoided in all member countries. moreover, countries need to improve the quality of their tax and expenditure policies as part of a comprehensive medium-term strategy, so as to strengthen confidence in a growth and employment-friendly, and sustainable, fiscal policy environment. with regard to structural reforms, over recent years euro area countries have become increasingly aware of the necessity to adjust to the challenges of increased global competition, ageing populations and accelerating technological change. in response, some have undertaken reform efforts to create more job opportunities. both as a reflection of these reforms and as a result of wage moderation in some countries, the euro area has seen a remarkable dynamism in employment growth over the recent period. notably, around 12 million new jobs were created in the euro area in the eight-year period since the start of stage three of emu. this compares favourably with the little more than two million new jobs created in the same group of countries in the eight years before 1999. however, the governing council notes that significant structural impediments continue to exist and contribute to explaining why unemployment rates are still unacceptably high and participation in the labour market is still low by international standards. with other countries in the world also increasing the competitiveness of their markets, it is essential for each euro area country to minimise the market distortions induced by its particular regulations and for the euro area as a whole to remove remaining barriers to market integration. this requires the implementation of comprehensive reforms necessary to deepen market integration, soften labour market rigidities and improve wage flexibility in order to continue fostering growth and new employment opportunities",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is061207.en.html,7 December 2006,"at today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. after today’s increase, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, with the key ecb interest rates remaining at low levels, money and credit growth strong, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. the governing council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. turning first to the economic analysis, according to eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real gdp in the euro area for the third quarter of 2006 was 0.5%. the data thus confirm our assessment that economic activity continued to expand robustly, while moderating from the very strong rates seen in the first half of the year. domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. the information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued in the fourth quarter of this year. looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential. while some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year, associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. as regards the external environment, economic growth has become more balanced across regions. helped in part by lower oil prices, global growth is robust, thereby providing support for euro area exports. domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. this outlook is also reflected in the new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 2.5% and 2.9% in 2006, between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2007 and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. in comparison with the september ecb staff projections, the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards, largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices and their impact on real disposable income. in the governing council’s view, the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the projection horizon lie on the downside. the main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the doha round of trade talks, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation rose to 1.8% in november 2006, from 1.6% in october and 1.7% in september. while no detailed breakdown of the november hicp data is available as of yet, the lower annual hicp inflation rates recorded in the two previous months reflected mainly the significant declines in crude oil prices from august onwards, as well as base effects. while the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, on the basis of the oil prices currently implied by the futures market overall inflation rates are likely to increase again in early 2007 and then hover around 2% in the course of that year, also reflecting the impact of higher indirect taxes.  the december eurosystem staff projections see annual hicp inflation at between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2006, between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007 and between 1.3% and 2.5% in 2008. most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. compared with the september 2006 ecb staff projections, the ranges for 2006 and 2007 are somewhat lower, largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices. in this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for short and long-term interest rates as well as for oil and non-energy commodity prices.  in the governing council’s view, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a pass-through of previous oil price increases which is stronger than assumed in the baseline scenario, the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. more fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, wage developments could be stronger than currently expected. therefore, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. wage agreements should take into account productivity developments in connection with the still high level of unemployment and positions in price competitiveness. it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. turning to the monetary analysis, annual m3 growth was unchanged at 8.5% in october, remaining close to the highest rates observed since the introduction of the euro, which points to inflationary risks at medium to longer horizons. increasing interest rates have exerted some influence over monetary developments in recent months, although as yet mainly by triggering shifts among the components of m3 rather than constraining the expansion of m3 itself. in particular, the annual growth rate of m1 has moderated somewhat, reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of m3 which offer more market-related returns.  more generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. in particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. in the context of rising interest rates, the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months, albeit at very high growth rates. by contrast, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12% on an annual basis, the highest seen since the early 1990s. thus, when the counterparts of m3 are considered, the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector. taking a medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ecb’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% in the coming two years, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. in addition, given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to long term. it is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. the governing council will therefore monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.  as regards fiscal policy, the european commission’s autumn forecasts suggest that deficits will fall below 3% of gdp in most euro area countries by 2007. this is welcome. however, the projected improvements in fiscal balances can only partly be attributed to substantial progress in structural consolidation, as higher economic growth and revenue windfalls are playing an important role. moreover, in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, adjustment efforts still fall short of what is needed to meet their respective medium-term objectives in a timely manner and thus fulfil the requirements of the revised stability and growth pact. this is of major concern. it is therefore crucial that forthcoming updates of the stability programmes not only envisage significant progress towards the correction of excessive deficits in a sustainable manner but also make sufficient headway towards safe budgetary positions in the countries concerned. for all countries it is paramount that pro-cyclical policies be avoided in the current economic upswing. more progress is also needed with fiscal structural reform as part of a comprehensive medium-term strategy to improve economic incentives and the soundness of social security systems. this would be a crucial contribution of fiscal policies to economic growth and fiscal sustainability as well as to confidence in the revised stability and growth pact. as regards structural reforms, the governing council welcomed the 2006 progress reports submitted by eu member states on their 2005-08 national reform programmes, in line with the renewed lisbon strategy. although it is encouraging that many concrete reform steps are being taken or are planned, there is still a considerable way to go to make the euro area a more dynamic economy, which is crucial to meeting the challenges of globalisation, population ageing and rapid technological change. reform measures should foster more integrated, flexible and competitive economies in the euro area, thus allowing more efficient adjustment processes and a stronger resilience to shocks. these are essential conditions for the substantial benefits of the single currency to be better exploited and for the economic performance to improve in both the euro area as a whole and in each member state",today decide increase key_interest_rate point decision reflect upside risk price stability medium_term identify economic monetary_analysis today decision

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is061102.en.html,2 November 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in october. it has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. with the key ecb interest rates at still low levels, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. if our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term. as emphasised on previous occasions, this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. eurostat’s second estimate confirmed that real gdp growth in the euro area was 0.9% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2006, after 0.8% in the first quarter. looking through the usual volatility of quarterly growth rates, economic activity has been growing at an average quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.7% over the four quarters to mid-2006, and thus faster than generally expected a year ago. on the basis of various monthly indicators of economic activity and confidence surveys, available up to october, the momentum of the economic expansion is expected to have continued in the second half of this year. in addition, the unemployment rate has been declining, employment growth has recovered and employment expectations remain favourable. all in all, the assessment of a more broadly based and more self-sustaining recovery continues to be confirmed by the incoming data, notwithstanding some possibility of a somewhat slower pace of quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth in the second half of this year than in the first. looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential, although some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year, mainly reflecting the impact of an increase in indirect taxes in a large euro area country in january 2007. global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and remains robust, thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports. investment is expected to remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve.  risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, taking into account, in particular, the recent slowing down in the us economy on the one hand and the recent fall in oil prices on the other. the oil price decline – if it were to prove lasting – has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in our current baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters. over the longer term, risks to growth continue to lie on the downside, relating mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the doha round of trade talks, and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 1.6% in october, after having declined to 1.7% in september from 2.3% in august. the recent decline in inflation is the combined result of favourable base effects, given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago, and the recent significant fall in oil prices. while the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets, inflation rates are likely to increase again in the next few months and early 2007. as a consequence, we expect a high degree of short-term volatility in the annual hicp inflation rate. looking through this volatility, however, hicp inflation will remain elevated at a level above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007.  risks to the outlook for price stability remain clearly on the upside. they continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. more fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the ongoing improvement in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability. against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, particularly in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. the monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. annual m3 growth rose again to 8.5% in september, after having increased to 8.2% in august. although the annual growth rate of m1 has moderated somewhat in recent months, reflecting shifts into instruments with more market-related returns in a context of rising interest rates, this has been more than compensated by the stronger expansion of the other components of m3.  more generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area and the strengthening of economic activity. in particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. while the growth of household borrowing shows some signs of stabilisation, albeit at very high rates, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12% on an annual basis, the highest seen since the early 1990s. thus, when the counterparts of m3 are considered, the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ecb’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area.  to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside. given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. it is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. if our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term. the governing council will therefore exercise strong vigilance. as regards fiscal policy, euro area countries have recently notified their deficit and debt figures for 2005 to the european commission, and most have reported on developments in 2006 and budget plans for 2007. while, on average, this information points to further, albeit slow improvements in budget balances, this should not give rise to complacency. it is important that commitments under the revised stability and growth pact are met in all euro area countries. it is essential that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current economic upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided. this would boost confidence among market participants and the public. to that effect any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be pre-committed and used in full to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses in good times. the prospects for attaining sound budgetary positions improve when consolidation plans are based on credible commitments to reduce expenditure ratios and better expenditure control mechanisms. finally, let me reiterate previous calls for high quality statistical data and sound statistical reporting, which are key for the prevention and correction of budgetary imbalances. as regards structural reforms, the governing council stressed the importance of creating a fully operational single market and flexible product and labour markets in order to enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area economy and its resilience to external shocks. liberalising product markets to allow more competition would raise incentives for firms to invest and innovate, thereby raising productivity growth. removing labour market rigidities and distortions in wage and price formation are key conditions for promoting more homogeneous cost and price competitiveness trends among euro area countries and for generating sustained output growth and job creation. in particular, wage increases should be guided, in general, by the trend in labour productivity growth, while taking full account of the present level of unit labour costs, in order to preserve or restore price competitiveness. moreover, it is desirable that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. the successful implementation of reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would raise potential growth and employment prospects",regular economic monetary_analysis decide today leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available far underpin reasoning decision

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is061005.en.html,5 October 2006,"at today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. also after today’s increase, the key ecb interest rates remain at low levels, money and credit growth are strong, and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. our monetary policy therefore continues to be accommodative. if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. the governing council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. turning first to the economic analysis, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real gdp in the euro area for the second quarter of 2006 was confirmed at 0.9%. moreover, since our previous meeting on 31 august, eurostat has revised upwards the growth data for the two preceding quarters, thereby confirming that a significant acceleration in economic expansion has taken place over the past few quarters. on the basis of the revised data, economic activity has been growing at a quarterly rate of 0.7% on average over the last four quarters, the unemployment rate has been on a falling trend, employment growth has recovered and employment expectations overall have remained favourable. all in all, the economic recovery now appears somewhat stronger than on the basis of earlier data. it has become more broadly based and is mainly supported by domestic demand. the available information on activity in the third quarter – coming from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – continues to support the assessment that economic activity will grow robustly while possibly moderating somewhat. looking ahead to the remainder of 2006 and 2007, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential, with some volatility in the quarterly growth rates likely to emerge around the turn of the year. global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and is still robust, thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports. investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve.  risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, although the recent fall in oil prices – if it were to prove lasting – has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in our baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters. over the longer term, risks to growth lie on balance on the downside, and relate mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the doha round of trade talks, and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  as regards price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation fell to 1.8% in september 2006, from 2.3% in august. although no detailed breakdown is available as yet, this relatively sharp decline seems to be the combined result of favourable base effects, given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago, and the recent significant fall in oil prices. while the outlook for energy prices is uncertain, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets, overall inflation rates are likely to increase again towards the end of the year and in early 2007. as a consequence, we expect a considerable degree of short-term volatility in the annual hicp inflation rate, while the overall inflation rate will remain elevated at levels above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007.  in addition, risks to the outlook for price developments remain clearly on the upside. they continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. more fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability. against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, in particular in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. the monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. annual m3 growth rose again to 8.2% in august and, more generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area. in particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, these developments remain consistent with the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ecb’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. moreover, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of still ample liquidity, as a result of the persistently high rate of monetary expansion over the past few years, point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area.  to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside. given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. it is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. the governing council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. as regards fiscal policy, euro area countries are now in the process of finalising their 2007 budgets and preparing their next stability programme updates. in the current favourable economic environment, it is essential that adequate headway be made towards sound public finances, implying that budget targets for 2007 should generally be more ambitious than in previous programmes. countries in excessive deficit need to remain fully committed to bringing their deficits to below 3% within the agreed deadline via adequate and credible structural consolidation. other countries need to make clear progress towards their medium-term objectives in line with the requirements of the stability and growth pact. in all cases, any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be used to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses. pro-cyclical policies should be avoided and expenditure restraint is of particular importance, also given the high spending ratios and taxes as compared with many other industrialised countries. experience has shown that expenditure reform is key to successful consolidation, and consolidation is essential for reducing overall public debt and for making public finances less vulnerable to the impact of ageing populations.  fiscal consolidation is likely to be most successful when coupled with comprehensive structural reforms. these are urgently needed to help to cushion the unfavourable economic effects of the projected demographic change in the euro area. the decline in the working age population will place further pressure on pension and health care systems, and may have wide-ranging economic consequences. in order to support the potential economic growth of the euro area, to foster macroeconomic flexibility and dynamism, and to safeguard the future standard of living of our citizens, labour and product market reforms are urgently needed. this will increase labour market participation and employment and strengthen innovation and the other forces driving productivity and economic growth. the ecb will play its part by continuing to maintain price stability over the medium term",today decide increase key_interest_rate point decision

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060831.en.html,31 August 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting we decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates earlier this month. it has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that upside risks to price stability are contained. with key ecb interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. if our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted. indeed, acting in a timely manner to contain risks to price stability remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area.  turning first to the economic analysis, all the main indicators in the euro area that have recently become available for the first half of the year show a significant improvement in underlying economic activity and indicate that economic growth was stronger than previously projected by official and private forecasters. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real gdp grew by 0.9% in the euro area in the second quarter of 2006, significantly above the 0.6% growth rate recorded in the previous quarter. in interpreting recent gdp data, due account needs to be taken of the degree of volatility of quarterly growth rates, but they generally confirm our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained. the information on activity in the third quarter – coming from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – continues to be favourable and supports the assessment of real gdp growing at rates around potential. looking forward, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to continue growing at around the potential rate. global economic activity remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further.  this outlook is also reflected in the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections, which for the first time include slovenia as part of the euro area projections for 2007. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2007. in comparison with the june eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards, mainly reflecting the stronger growth recorded in the first half of this year, along with continued positive signals from a number of other indicators.  it is the governing council’s view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. over the longer term, uncertainty has augmented and downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, global imbalances and protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the doha round of trade talks.  with respect to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 2.3% in august 2006, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. during the second half of 2006, and on average also in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain elevated at above 2%, with the precise levels depending mainly on future energy price developments. while in our main scenario the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in the remainder of 2006 and in 2007 – partly reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – lagged indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced increases in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year.  in the new ecb staff projections, annual hicp inflation is projected to lie between 2.3% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2007. compared with the june 2006 eurosystem staff projections, the range for 2006 is within the upper part of the previous range, while that for 2007 has been shifted slightly upwards, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices. in the view of the governing council, risks to this outlook for price developments remain on the upside. they include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage developments.  against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail continues to be confirmed by the monetary analysis. the rates of monetary and credit expansion remain rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area. in particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, with this rapid growth remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. the moderation of annual m3 growth observed in the past two months – to 8.5% in june and 7.8% in july – may possibly reflect the impact of previous increases in interest rates. however, it also needs to be viewed against the high growth rate witnessed in may, which represented one of the highest annual rates of m3 growth seen since the introduction of the euro. more generally, recent monetary developments should be assessed with the appropriate medium-term perspective, and thus against the background of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion observed since mid-2004. on this basis, liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all reasonable measures. continued strong monetary and credit growth in the context of already ample liquidity points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, especially against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing to be clearly on the upside. given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. it is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. accordingly, strong vigilance is warranted in order to ensure that risks to price stability are contained. if our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. acting in a timely manner will make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. as regards fiscal policy, in several member states public finances appear to be on track to meet or even exceed this year’s targets as the favourable economic situation, revenue windfalls and effective consolidation measures exert a positive influence on fiscal balances. however, in other countries, the current fiscal outlook suggests a shortfall in terms of the required structural improvement in public finances. this is worrying in view of the objectives and commitments agreed under the revised stability and growth pact. it is therefore essential that 2006 budgets are executed strictly during the remainder of this year, and that budget plans for 2007 and beyond are sufficiently ambitious. all countries should take advantage of the current economic recovery to consolidate fiscal balances. especially countries in excessive deficit procedure and with a high debt-to-gdp ratio should use the current economic recovery to bring the public deficit ratio to below 3% within the agreed deadline, and more ambitious fiscal consolidation is essential to achieve the medium-term objectives. it is also crucial that comprehensive reform programmes strengthen economic incentives and enhance the sustainability of social security systems. this is the best contribution that fiscal policies can make towards building confidence in the outlook for growth and stability in the euro area and in the revised stability and growth pact. as regards structural reforms, the governing council stresses the need to raise the potential growth rate of the euro area, to foster incentives to work and to strengthen the euro area’s capacity to absorb shocks. comprehensive reform measures to ensure a fully operational internal market, a higher degree of wage and price flexibility, and a more favourable business environment would offer new opportunities for firms and workers and promote investment, innovation and job creation. such structural reforms would not only help to underpin the momentum of the ongoing economic recovery, but would also safeguard the standard of living of euro area citizens in the longer run",regular economic monetary_analysis today decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged information available far underpin reasoning decision increase interest_rate early

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060803.en.html,3 August 2006,"at today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. it will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. as stressed on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. also after today’s increase, the key ecb interest rates remain low in both real and nominal terms, money and credit growth remain strong, and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. our monetary policy therefore continues to be accommodative. if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted. against this background, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. the main indicators of economic activity that have become available since the july press conference have tended to confirm our baseline scenario for economic growth in the euro area. eurostat’s second release verified that, in the first quarter of 2006, real gdp grew by 0.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. economic activity is also becoming more broadly based on domestic demand. moreover, the currently available information on economic activity in the second quarter – such as various confidence surveys and monthly indicators – supports the view that economic growth has continued at a sustained pace. the survey information so far available for the third quarter is also in line with our baseline scenario.  looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for real gdp in the euro area to grow at around its potential rate, as projected by eurosystem staff in june. growth in the economies of the euro area’s main trading partners is providing ongoing support for euro area exports. investment growth is expected to continue benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and improvements in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in employment growth and hence real disposable income. this generally favourable outlook for economic activity in the euro area is also reflected in forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions. risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, although recent geopolitical tensions and their impact on markets are a timely reminder of the uncertainties that we face. medium to longer-term risks lie on the downside and relate in particular to the potential for further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the doha round of trade talks. turning to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 2.5% in july 2006, unchanged from june and may. in the second half of 2006 and on average in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending very much on future energy price developments. while the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 – also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage and price developments owing to second-round effects of past oil price increases at a time of gradually improving labour markets.  regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis. while the data for june 2006 show some moderation in the annual growth rate of m3, these latest developments remain consistent with a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion since mid-2004. the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates in the euro area has been an important factor behind the tendency for money and credit growth to strengthen over recent quarters.  looking at the counterparts of m3, the expansion of credit to the private sector remains the main driver of monetary dynamics. on an annual basis, loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months, with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly. ongoing strong lending to households continues to be explained, in particular, by borrowing for house purchases. the dynamic growth of money and credit, in an environment of already ample liquidity, points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets.  to sum up, annual inflation rates are expected to remain elevated, at above 2% on average, in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook on the upside. given strong monetary and credit growth in a context of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. a further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. by acting today in a timely fashion, the governing council is helping to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. looking ahead, given that our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed. the governing council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. concerning fiscal policies, given the outlook for economic growth, it is of crucial importance that euro area governments avoid pro-cyclical policies and step up the pace of fiscal consolidation. as budgetary targets for the current year are not particularly ambitious, a rigorous implementation of plans on the expenditure side is especially warranted, and any additional windfall revenues are best used for deficit reduction. beyond the implementation of such prudent policies in the remainder of this year, the medium-term focus of fiscal policies should be on correcting the underlying sources of imbalances in public finances. euro area governments, many of which are now finalising their budget plans for 2007, should take full advantage of the economic environment to bring forward the structural adjustment necessary for the durable correction of excessive deficits, so as to reach their medium-term budgetary objectives at an early stage and thereby prepare public finances for the acute demographic challenges they must cope with.  as regards structural reforms, it is essential, for europe’s future, to ensure that it has a fully operational internal market, allowing a free flow of labour and capital and free trade in goods and services. removing the remaining barriers within the eu will be a powerful means to promote the efficient allocation of factors of production as well as deeper economic and financial integration. this in turn would allow the eu to realise its substantial potential for stronger output and employment growth and to increase its resilience to shocks. exploiting the opportunities of the single market will help to safeguard the prosperity of the citizens of europe. for those member states which have fulfilled the convergence criteria laid down by the treaty and participate in the euro area, the considerable benefits of the internal market are further enhanced by the single currency, which offers them a credible framework for monetary policy and price stability in an environment characterised by the absence of exchange rate uncertainty within the euro area, low long-term interest rates, price and cost transparency, reduced transaction and information costs and stronger insurance against economic and financial instability.  in this respect, the further enlargement of the euro area on 1 january 2007 with the entry of slovenia will be a new historical landmark. in order to fully reap the advantages of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate efficiently within the enlarged currency area, it will be necessary to fully integrate slovenia into economic and monetary union, which calls for all remaining barriers to be removed, including those related to labour mobility. indeed, open, competitive and flexible markets are of particular importance for the functioning of the euro area economy and the smooth conduct of the single monetary policy. for its part, the governing council has undertaken all the necessary preparations to make banka slovenije an integral part of the eurosystem",today decide increase key_interest_rate point decision reflect upside risk price stability medium_term identify economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060706.en.html,6 July 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting we decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. the information that has become available since our last meeting has confirmed that a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation was warranted to contain upside risks to price stability. indeed, acting in a timely manner to contain such risks remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. with key ecb interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. therefore, if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. against this background, we will exercise strong vigilance so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.  turning first to the economic analysis, the latest data and survey releases remain positive and, in general, have improved further. on balance, this confirms our assessment that economic growth has both regained momentum and become more broadly based and sustained in the first half of 2006. looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for continued economic growth at rates around potential, despite possible volatility in the quarterly figures. global economic activity remains strong, providing support for euro area exports. investment is expected to pick up, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity is also reflected in the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions.  the risks to the outlook for economic growth appear to be balanced over the shorter term, while in the longer term downside risks prevail, relating mainly to potential further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and potential pressures for increased protectionism. with respect to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 2.5% in june 2006, the same rate as in may and compared with 2.4% in april. during the second half of 2006, and on average in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments. this assessment is supported by the eurosystem staff projections and available public and private sector forecasts. while the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 – also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. against this background, and also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently expected, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes and, more fundamentally, stronger than expected wage and price developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases.  regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis. money and credit growth have strengthened further over recent quarters, with the latest annual growth rate of m3 increasing to 8.9% in may – the highest annual growth of m3 since the start of stage three of emu. the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates in the euro area remains an important driving factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion. on an annual basis, loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months, with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly. ongoing strong lending activity to households continues to be explained, in particular, by borrowing for house purchases, which has stood at an annual rate of above 12% in recent months. the dynamic growth of money and credit, in an environment of already ample liquidity, points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. monetary developments, therefore, require enhanced monitoring, particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets.  to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing to be on the upside. given the dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. it is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. accordingly, the governing council will exercise strong vigilance so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation.  in terms of fiscal policy, the overall pace of consolidation is disappointing against the background of the favourable outlook for growth. consolidation targets continue to be at risk, notably in a number of countries with an excessive deficit. the governing council therefore reiterates its position that it is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past. it also wishes to express its broad agreement with the main fiscal challenges as generally identified by the european commission. these concern, in particular, the need for a rigorous implementation of the revised stability and growth pact with a view to speeding up fiscal consolidation and improving the outlook for fiscal sustainability. this needs to be underpinned by medium term-oriented structural reform strategies and appropriate national fiscal institutions and procedures. finally, reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics remain essential for the european fiscal framework. meeting these challenges will support confidence in the soundness of public finances and in economic prospects in europe. as regards structural reforms, enhancing the growth potential of the euro area, increasing job opportunities and strengthening the euro area’s ability to cope with the challenges of globalisation are among the most demanding economic policy issues of our time. in order to translate the opportunities brought about by globalisation – in terms of higher living standards – into achievements, the euro area would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets. it would also gain from a more favourable business environment and a fully fledged internal market – including in the services sector – that foster innovation, investment and the creation of new firms. indeed, implementing the necessary reforms in a decisive manner would both help to reap the benefits that globalisation and the single market offer our citizens and raise the production

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060608.en.html,8 June 2006,"at today’s meeting, we decided to increase the  key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that have been identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. the further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will thus contribute to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. as stressed on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. overall, also after today’s increase, the key ecb interest rates are still low by historical standards, liquidity is ample and our monetary policy remains accommodative. given the outlook for price developments and the dynamism of money and credit growth in the euro area, we will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. all the main indicators of economic activity that have recently become available are positive. according to eurostat’s first estimate, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real gdp grew by 0.6% in the euro area in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 0.3% in the previous quarter, with domestic demand making a significant contribution. the expected re-acceleration of real gdp growth in the first months of 2006 has thus materialised, confirming our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained. this assessment is further supported by information on activity in the second quarter – such as various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – which continues to be encouraging.  looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for growth in the euro area to remain close to its trend potential rate, despite the impact of the rise in oil prices. growth in the economies of the euro area’s main trading partners remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. strong investment growth is expected to continue, benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves.  this outlook is also reflected in the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which provide additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.8% and 2.4% in 2006, and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2007. the growth projections for 2006 are broadly unchanged from the ecb staff projections of march 2006, while those for 2007 are slightly lower, reflecting mainly the recent rise in oil prices. most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. it is the governing council’s view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, while longer-term downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, global imbalances and protectionism. turning to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation increased to 2.5% in may, compared with 2.4% in april and 2.2% in march. although no detailed information is available as yet, this increase probably stems from energy price developments. in the months to come and in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments. while the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 – also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – indirect effects of past oil price increases and the announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to have a significant upward effect on inflation. against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is provided by the june eurosystem staff projections. annual hicp inflation is projected to lie between 2.1% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. compared with the march 2006 ecb staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward shift to the profile for hicp inflation in 2006, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices. in the view of the governing council, risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases.  turning to the monetary analysis, the governing council again had a thorough discussion of underlying developments in money and credit. in a context of already ample liquidity and very strong monetary and credit growth, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further in recent months to reach double-digit levels. credit growth has also been broadly based across sectors. borrowing by households – especially for house purchase – and by non-financial corporations has been growing very strongly. at the same time, monetary growth has risen further over the past few months, with the annual growth rate of m3 standing at 8.8% in april.  the rapid rate of monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components. thus, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion, which signals inflationary risks over the medium to longer term. the further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment of already ample liquidity points to increased upside risks to price stability at longer horizons. monetary developments, therefore, require careful monitoring, in particular in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook on the upside. given the strength of monetary and credit growth and the ample liquidity situation, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail. a further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. by acting in a timely fashion, the governing council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. overall, our monetary policy remains accommodative and the governing council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. with regard to fiscal policies, the forecasts published recently by the commission point to a broadly unchanged situation in the euro area in 2006 and 2007; deficit ratios are expected to remain at around the 2005 level of 2.4%, while debt ratios, after declining only marginally, are forecast at levels still above 70% of gdp. this is disappointing against the background of the economic outlook. most countries with an excessive deficit have not corrected their position in a timely manner. furthermore, there is a risk of consolidation delays in other countries. it is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past, when many countries failed to consolidate sufficiently in good times. the governing council considers that more determined progress is required towards sound public finances in a number of countries, that concrete and credible measures should be implemented swiftly as part of a medium-term-oriented strategy, and that it is vital to consolidate confidence in the revised stability and growth pact by ensuring the sustainability of public finances in the euro area. in terms of structural reforms, the governing council reiterates its call for the implementation of firm measures to ensure open, competitive and well-functioning product and labour markets, so as to foster an attractive environment for investment and innovation and to promote flexibility in wages and prices. there is a broad and firm consensus that such reforms are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and in enhancing the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks. at the same time, these reforms would further facilitate intra-euro area adjustments by reducing rigidities that contribute, in some economies, to wage developments that lead to high and persistent unit labour cost growth, higher inflationary pressure and losses in competitiveness. examples of such rigidities are low productivity growth due to a lack of competition in some sectors and an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices. all in all, a comprehensive set of reforms is essential to strengthen the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment across the euro area, to underpin the ongoing economic recovery and to further smoothen the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area, thereby facilitating the conduct of the single monetary policy",today decide increase key_interest_rate point decision reflect upside risk price stability medium_term identify economic

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060504.en.html,4 May 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. overall, the information which has become available since our last meeting broadly confirms our earlier assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic activity in the euro area, and that monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic. against this background, the governing council will exercise strong vigilance in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. such vigilance is particularly warranted in a context of ample liquidity and still very low levels of nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum, implying an overall accommodative monetary policy stance. for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area, inflation expectations must be firmly anchored.  let me now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. the data that have become available since the start of the year point to a re-acceleration of economic growth in the first quarter of 2006, following the moderation observed in the last quarter of 2005. in addition, the latest indicators and survey information point to continued growth in the second quarter and lend support to the scenario of a gradual broadening in economic activity as embodied in the march 2006 ecb staff projections. business confidence is particularly buoyant, which, in principle, bodes well for investment, and the recovery in consumption and employment appears to be proceeding, albeit still gradually. looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for continued growth over the coming quarters. activity in the world economy is expected to remain strong, providing continued support for euro area exports. investment growth should benefit from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation continues to improve. this favourable outlook for economic growth is broadly in line with available forecasts from international organisations and the private sector. considering the information available, risks to this scenario appear broadly balanced over the shorter term, although recently oil prices have again demonstrated high volatility and their potential for posing downside risks to growth. this underlines the need for further improvement in the transparency of oil markets and further investment in this sector. concerns about global imbalances continue to prevail over longer horizons, as do risks relating to protectionism  with regard to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 2.4% in april 2006, compared with 2.2% in march and 2.3% in february. in the short term, annual inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, with the month-to-month profile largely dependent on developments in oil prices and the strength of their pass-through to other prices along the production chain. beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to affect inflation significantly in 2007 and a further upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. at the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate in recent quarters and wage growth is expected to remain contained, partly reflecting global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. recent wage moderation has helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures. looking ahead, it is equally crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, not least with a view to fostering employment growth. risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage developments than expected at present, possibly due to second-round effects stemming from past oil price increases. turning to the monetary analysis, in a context of ample liquidity in the euro area, monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic. in particular, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months and has now reached double-digit levels. credit growth has also become more broadly based across sectors, with borrowing both by households – especially for house purchase – and by non-financial corporations growing more strongly. monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components. thus the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion. overall, further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. monetary developments, therefore, require careful monitoring, especially in the light of the strengthening of economic activity and, in particular, of strong asset price dynamics, especially in housing markets. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 and the economic analysis confirms that the risks to price stability continue to lie on the upside. some of these risks appear to have increased in view of the renewed strength of oil prices. given strong money and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. it therefore remains crucial to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability – a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. accordingly, particular vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. with respect to fiscal policies, there are some signs that the implementation of the stability and growth pact and commitment to the rules have improved since last year’s revision. however, fiscal targets in a number of cases are rather lenient and their attainment is still subject to considerable risks. the governing council therefore supports any further reinforcement of fiscal consolidation efforts that also takes full advantage of a more favourable economic environment. appropriately ambitious fiscal targets as part of a comprehensive structural reform programme would bring deficit and debt ratios down more rapidly. this is decisive in order to secure the sustainability of public finances. such strategies would also boost confidence in the economic prospects of the euro area. as regards structural reforms, the governing council again stresses the importance of undertaking comprehensive reforms to ensure open, competitive and well-functioning labour and product markets, including the promotion of wage and price flexibility and the fostering of an attractive environment for investment and innovation. the need for such reforms has again been highlighted by recent oil price developments, as they would enhance the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks. there is a broad and firm consensus that openness and flexibility are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and it is now essential to turn the agreed reform plans into actions and to strengthen them where necessary. by pushing forward with ambitious structural reforms, euro area countries will also lend support to the ongoing economic recovery",regular economic monetary_analysis decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged overall information available broadly

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060406.en.html,6 April 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged, following the increase of 25 basis points on 2 march 2006. the information which has become available since then confirms our assessment that a further adjustment of our accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted to address upside risks to price stability. it remains essential to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. with interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum still at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and monetary and credit growth remaining strong and liquidity ample, our monetary policy remains accommodative. we will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.  turning first to the economic analysis, recent information has confirmed our assessment of an improved outlook for economic growth in the euro area, following the more subdued developments in late 2005. on the basis of the latest data, survey releases and various indicator-based estimates, it appears that growth is strengthening and broadening in the first half of 2006. indeed, the conditions remain in place for solid growth over the coming quarters. activity in the world economy remains strong, providing support for euro area exports. investment activity is expected to remain solid, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation continues to gradually improve. this outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts from international organisations and private sector institutions.  the risks to economic growth appear to be broadly balanced over the shorter term. further ahead, downside risks still relate to potential increases in oil prices and concerns about global imbalances.  turning to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 2.2% in march 2006, compared with 2.3% in february and 2.4% in january. in the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, with the precise levels depending largely on developments in the more volatile components of the index. beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. at the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over recent quarters and growth in wages is expected to remain contained, partly reflecting strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. over the recent past, moderate wage trends have helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures; looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a possibly stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases.  turning to the monetary analysis, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion. moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months, with borrowing by households – especially loans for house purchase – and non-financial corporations rising rapidly. overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that the risks to price stability remain on the upside. given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation in a context of improving economic activity, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability over the medium to long term prevail. it is essential that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. accordingly, the governing council will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation.  as regards fiscal policies, while the budgetary results reported for 2005 are mostly better than anticipated a few months ago, the budget balances planned for 2006 imply no significant progress in fiscal consolidation for the euro area as a whole. given the economic outlook, a faster pace of deficit reduction is necessary. delaying fiscal consolidation in times of improving economic activity implies risks for the medium term, as has been observed in the past. speeding up deficit reduction on the basis of credible and fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive reform programme would help to enhance confidence in the medium-term prospects of the euro area and prevent a repeat of past experiences, when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria. as regards structural reforms, the governing council welcomes the call by the european council, which met in brussels on 23-24 march 2006, to maintain the momentum of the re-launched lisbon strategy for growth and employment. as emphasised by the european council, the focus should now be on ensuring the effective, timely and comprehensive implementation of the measures agreed in the national reform programmes presented by member states and, if necessary, on strengthening them. these measures are designed to, among other things, enhance the sustainability and quality of public finances, promote flexible labour and product markets, support a favourable business environment, and ensure a fully operational eu internal market, including the markets for energy and services. applying comprehensive structural reforms is of particular importance for the euro area countries, in order to increase wage and price flexibility and the resilience to shocks, facilitate structural adjustment, raise potential output growth and job creation, and reduce price pressures, thereby facilitating the task of

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060302.en.html,2 March 2006,"at today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points. this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability that we have identified on the basis of both our economic and monetary analyses. the adjustment of interest rates will contribute to ensuring that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, which is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum still remain at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and our monetary policy remains accommodative. while this policy stance reflects our current assessment, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. according to eurostat’s flash estimate, quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth in the euro area was 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005. this was considerably lower than the strong 0.6% recorded in the previous quarter. however, looking through the short-term volatility and assessing recent economic indicators and survey information, the evidence suggests that economic activity is improving. accordingly, we should see stronger growth rates over the short term, as also reflected in various indicator-based estimates.  looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for ongoing economic expansion in the euro area. the external environment remains favourable, providing support for euro area exports. investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring and gains in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves.  the march ecb staff macroeconomic projections have provided an additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. these projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 1.7% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007. the results constitute a slight upward revision to the eurosystem staff projections of december 2005, mainly reflecting a somewhat stronger outlook for private investment over the projection horizon. most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. in the view of the governing council, downside risks to this outlook for growth relate mainly to oil price developments and global imbalances. turning to price developments, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation was 2.3% in february 2006, compared with 2.4% in january. in the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain at above 2%, with the precise levels depending strongly on future energy price developments, which have recently been relatively volatile. beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact can also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. at the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over the recent past; our working assumption is that this will continue to be the case, due not least to strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. moderate wage trends have helped to contain domestic inflationary pressure despite strong oil price increases. therefore, looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is again provided by the march ecb staff projections. annual hicp inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. compared with the december 2005 eurosystem staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward revision to the profile for hicp inflation over the coming years, reflecting mainly an increase in the assumption for future oil prices, in line with market expectations. risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases.  turning to the monetary analysis, the governing council has again discussed the assessment of monetary developments in depth. the annual growth rate of m3 remains robust, notwithstanding signs of a resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts into monetary assets, which exerts a dampening effect on headline m3 growth. looking through the short-term effects generated by such portfolio behaviour, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates. moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has strengthened further over recent months, with borrowing by households – especially loans for house purchase – and non-financial corporations rising at a marked pace. overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. to sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail. an adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. by acting in a timely fashion, the governing council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability and thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. the governing council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise.  as regards fiscal policies, while some countries plan to maintain or attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the horizon of their stability programmes, progress towards sound public finances in the euro area as a whole remains slow. a number of countries continue to report severe imbalances, and in some of them consolidation efforts barely attain the minimum required by the revised stability and growth pact, despite the improving growth outlook. at the same time, the fiscal costs of population ageing cast a shadow over the long-term fiscal outlook for most euro area countries. it is therefore essential that countries pursue a more determined consolidation, introducing concrete and effective measures where needed. these consolidation efforts will more easily succeed if they are embedded in a comprehensive reform programme that adequately prepares for the long-term fiscal challenges. this will enhance the credibility of the revised pact and create confidence in a sound and growth-friendly fiscal environment. the broader implications of population ageing also require attention in other fields of economic policy. comprehensive structural reforms in labour and product markets and the creation of a favourable and competitive environment for firms are vital to support potential growth and raise employment rates as the demographic effects materialise. completing the eu internal market – including the market for services – should be a key priority. on the labour supply side, tax and benefit system reforms are essential to provide stronger incentives for people to stay in or enter the labour market. on the labour demand side, there is a need to promote wage flexibility and address labour market rigidities. moreover, better education and training are important for the development of human capital. the forthcoming meeting of the european council on 23-24 march 2006 will review progress made with the lisbon strategy, which was relaunched last year. we

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060202.en.html,2 February 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged. we have also concluded that the most recent information from the economic analysis broadly underpins our assessment of the outlook for price developments and the euro area economy, and that monetary and credit growth remains strong and liquidity ample. against this background, we will exercise vigilance so as to ensure the solid anchoring of long-term inflation expectations at levels in line with price stability. such vigilance is also warranted, given the historically low levels of both nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum and the overall accommodative stance of monetary policy. in order for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area, inflation expectations must be firmly anchored.  let me now explain our assessment in more detail. turning first to the economic analysis, recent data continue to lend support to the scenario for economic activity embodied in the december 2005 eurosystem staff projections. hence, our assessment of the outlook for growth in the euro area has been broadly confirmed. economic activity started to improve and broaden in the second half of 2005 and, on the basis of the latest indicators and survey data, it appears that this process has basically continued, taking into account the usual degree of volatility of quarterly growth rates. looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to continue over the coming quarters. the external environment is favourable, providing support for euro area exports. investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. this outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts.  downside risks to economic growth, relating, in particular, to persistently high and volatile oil prices and concerns about global imbalances, still dominate on the external side.  in relation to price developments, annual hicp inflation was 2.2% in december, down from 2.3% in november and 2.5% in october. over the short term, annual inflation rates may again increase somewhat, reflecting in particular renewed increases in energy prices and some base effects. looking further ahead, indirect effects of past oil price rises on other components of the price index may gradually materialise, and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact on hicp inflation. meanwhile, wage dynamics have remained moderate over recent quarters and are assumed to remain so for the time being, reflecting, in particular, global competitive pressure. all in all, currently available information is broadly in line with the scenario embodied in the december 2005 eurosystem staff projections for hicp inflation over this year and next.  risks to this outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further rises in oil prices, a pass-through of oil prices into consumer prices stronger than currently envisaged, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – potential second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. it is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 remains robust, even though it moderated further in december. this moderation can be explained in part by an apparent resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts, which exerts a dampening effect on headline m3 growth. however, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the prevailing low level of interest rates. in particular, growth in the most liquid components of m3 continues to be very robust and the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further. mortgage borrowing is particularly buoyant, implying a need to monitor developments in the housing market closely. overall, strong monetary and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.  to sum up, the economic analysis suggests that indirect effects stemming from past oil price rises and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact on annual hicp inflation over the coming years. it also indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. cross-checking the outcome of our economic analysis with that of our monetary analysis supports the case for vigilance to ensure that the risks to price stability over the medium to longer term do not materialise. it is indeed essential that such risks do not affect medium and long-term inflation expectations, which need to remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation  as regards fiscal policy, recent information points to somewhat better than expected outcomes for 2005 in a number of countries and for the euro area as a whole. with the improvements in economic growth, determined fiscal consolidation is now even more important. in particular, countries with excessive deficits must take this opportunity to reduce their fiscal imbalances in a decisive and sustainable manner. this would strongly support the european fiscal framework as established by the stability and growth pact. delaying consolidation would be both inappropriate in the short term and risky in the longer term. adjustment efforts should be based on credible, fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive consolidation programme. any windfall gains from higher than expected growth or other factors should be allocated to speeding up deficit reduction. this would help to prevent a repeat of past experiences, when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria. with respect to structural reforms, the governing council discussed a range of issues relating to the euro area services sector. services-related activities represent an important input for other sectors of the economy and account for a large, growing share of output and employment in the euro area, standing, in both cases, at around 70% in recent years. given the services sector’s increasingly important role, the need to ensure a fully integrated internal market for services in the european union is at the forefront of the european policy agenda. structural reforms aimed at increasing competition in both eu and international services markets would allow firms to benefit from economies of scale and should be expected to increase economic efficiency. this would support both a higher level and stronger growth rate of labour productivity in the services sector, promote a more dynamic economy and create more jobs. moreover, a higher level of competition in the services market should have a dampening impact on prices and would contribute to the reduction of price stickiness in some areas of the services sector. overall, opening up the services sector to new entrants would tend to foster more efficient and flexible services markets, facilitate adjustment processes and increase the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks. this would support economic growth and employment in the longer run",regular economic monetary_analysis decide leave key_interest_rate unchanged conclude recent information

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2006/html/is060112.en.html,12 January 2006,"on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged following the increase of 25 basis points on 1 december 2005. the information which has become available since then supports the assessment that an adjustment of our very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. it remains essential to keep medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, and we will consistently apply it when examining new information, making our judgements and taking decisions. with interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum remaining historically low in both nominal and real terms, and with our monetary policy stance remaining accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term.  allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. according to the information available, real gdp growth did indeed improve in the second half of 2005, as we expected. according to eurostat’s first estimate, real gdp grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.6% in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 0.4% in the second quarter. the breakdown of gdp data for the third quarter of 2005 confirmed a stronger contribution from domestic demand. moreover, recent economic indicators and survey data support the view that the expansion of economic activity broadly maintained its momentum in the fourth quarter of 2005 and will continue to do so in the first months of 2006, notwithstanding the impact of high oil prices.  looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for sustained growth of economic activity, in line with our staff projections and other available forecasts. on the external side, the continued strength of global demand should support euro area exports. on the domestic side, investment should further benefit from continued very favourable financing conditions, robust corporate earnings and gains in corporate efficiency. consumption growth should gradually rise, broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income.  risks to this outlook for economic growth continue to lie on the downside and relate to high and volatile oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and the level of consumer confidence in the euro area, although the latter is improving.  turning to price developments, annual hicp inflation was 2.2% in december, according to eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.3% in november and 2.5% in october. this decline was the result of some relaxation of earlier tensions in oil and petrol markets. nevertheless, annual hicp inflation rates are expected to remain at elevated levels over the short term, mainly on account of the most recent increases in oil prices and some adverse base effects. beyond the short term, indirect effects of past oil price rises on other components of the price index may gradually materialise, and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact. meanwhile, wage increases have remained moderate over recent quarters. all in all, the information available remains consistent with the scenario for price developments as reflected in the december staff projections. risks to this scenario remain on the upside and include further rises in oil prices, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as – more fundamentally – potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour. it is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of m3 moderated somewhat in november, but remained very robust, mainly owing to the stimulative impact of the prevailing low level of interest rates. the strong growth of m3 continues to be driven by significant contributions from its most liquid components. the growth of loans to the private sector – and, in particular, mortgage borrowing – has strengthened further over recent months, from already rapid rates of growth. against this background, price dynamics in the housing markets need to be monitored closely. liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all plausible measures. strong monetary and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity in the euro area points to upside risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. to sum up, the economic analysis suggests that some upward impact on hicp inflation will result from the indirect effects of recent oil price rises and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes. it also indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. this assessment is confirmed by cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis. it is essential that such risks do not affect medium-term inflation expectations, which need to remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. monetary policy can thereby effectively contribute to sustainable economic growth and job creation. accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term.  as regards fiscal policy, most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes, which include their medium-term budget plans. the upcoming assessment of these programmes by the ecofin council and their subsequent implementation provide an opportunity to forcefully underpin the commitment to sound fiscal policies and the rigorous implementation of the stability and growth pact. this would have an important positive effect on confidence. this effect is likely to be considerable if emphasis is given to well-defined and credible consolidation measures, restraint in expenditure commitments, and the incorporation of fiscal measures into a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform agenda.  with respect to structural reforms, the governing council welcomes the ecofin council’s conclusions of 6 december 2005 on the lisbon national reform programmes and the intended response to the challenges of globalisation. in fact, the process of international economic and financial integration, characterised by strong growth in trade and capital flows, has been one of the driving factors behind the rise in europe’s prosperity over the past decades. the ongoing transformation of the world economy, reflecting technological advances and the entrance of new economies into the world market, again offers great opportunities in terms of higher living standards. in order to translate these chances into achievements, europe would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets so as to speed up the necessary changeover from contracting to expanding activities and to minimise adjustment costs. it would also profit considerably from a more stimulative business environment which fosters the ability to innovate, invest and create new firms. moreover, a fully operational eu internal market, including for services, offers great opportunities. the initiatives taken to relaunch the lisbon strategy are a welcome step in the right
